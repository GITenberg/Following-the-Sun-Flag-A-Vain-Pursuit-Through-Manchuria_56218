<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p class="indent">After a long still-hunt in Tokio, and a
long pursuit through Manchuria, following
that Sun-Flag of Japan, I gave up the chase
at Liao-Yang.</p>

<p class="indent">Not being a military expert, my purpose was
simply to see under that flag the brown little
&quot;gun-man&quot;&mdash;as he calls himself in his own
tongue&mdash;in camp and on the march, in trench
and in open field, in assault and in retreat;
to tell tales of his heroism, chivalry, devotion,
sacrifice, incomparable patriotism; to see
him fighting, wounded&mdash;and, since such things
in war must be&mdash;dying, dead. After seven
months my spoils of war were post-mortem
battle-fields, wounded convalescents in hospitals,
deserted trenches, a few graves, and one
Russian prisoner in a red shirt.</p>

<p class="indent">Upon that unimportant personal disaster I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagex" id="pagex"></a>[pg&nbsp;x]</span>
can look back now with no little amusement;
and were I to re-write these articles, I should
doubtless temper both word and spirit here
and there; but as my feeling at the time was
sincere, natural, and justified, as there is, I
believe, no over-statement of the facts that
caused it, and as the articles were written without
malice or the least desire to &quot;get even&quot;&mdash;I
let them go, as written, into book form now.</p>

<p class="indent">No more enthusiastic pro-Japanese than I
ever touched foot on the shores of the little
island, and no Japanese, however much he
might, if only for that reason, value my good
opinion, can regret more than I any change
that took place within me when I came face to
face with a land and a people I had longed
since childhood to see.</p>

<p class="indent">I am very sorry to have sounded the personal
note so relentlessly in this little book.
That, too, was unavoidable, and will, I hope,
be pardoned.</p>

<p class="h2">I</p>

<p class="h2">THE TRAIL OF THE SAXON</p>

<p class="indent">An amphitheatre of feathery clouds ran half
around the horizon and close to the water&#39;s
edge; midway and toward Russia rose a great
dark shadow through which the sun shone
faintly. Such was the celestial setting for the
entrance of a certain ship some ten days since
at sunset into the harbor of Yokohama and the
Land of the Rising Sun; but no man was to
guess from the strange pictures, strange people,
and jumbled mass of new ideas and impressions
waiting to make his brain dizzy on shore,
that the big cloud aloft was the symbol of actual
war. No sign was to come, by night or by
day, from the tiled roofs, latticed windows,
paper houses, the foreign architectural monstrosities
of wood and stone; the lights, lanterns,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id="page2"></a>[pg&nbsp;2]</span>
shops&mdash;tiny and brilliantly lit; the innumerable
rickshas, the swift play under them
of muscular bare brown legs which bore thin-chested
men who run open-mouthed and smoke
cigarettes while waiting a fare; the musical
chorus of getas clicking on stone, mounted by
men bareheaded or in billycock hats; little
women in kimonos; ponies with big bellies,
apex rumps, bushy forelocks and mean eyes;
rows of painted dolls caged behind barred windows
and under the glare of electric lights&mdash;expectant,
waiting, patient&mdash;hour by hour,
night after night, no suggestion save perhaps
in their idle patience; coolies with push carts,
staggering under heavy loads, &quot;cargadores&quot; in
straw hats and rain coats of rushes, looking for
all the world like walking little haycocks&mdash;no
sign except in flags, the red sunbursts of Japan,
along now and then with the Stars and Stripes&mdash;flags
which, for all else one could know,
might have been hung out for a holiday.</p>

<p class="indent">For more than a month I had been on the
trail of the Saxon, the westward trail on which
he set his feet more than a hundred years ago,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>[pg&nbsp;3]</span>
when he cut the apron-strings of Mother England,
turned his back on her, and, without
knowing it, started back toward her the other
way round the world, to clasp hands, perhaps,
again across the Far East. Where he started,
I started, too, from the top of the Cumberland
over which he first saw the Star of Empire
beckoning westward only. I went through a
black tunnel straight under the trail his moccasined
feet wore over Cumberland Gap, and
stopped, for a moment, in a sleeper on the spot
where he pitched his sunset camp for the night;
and the blood of his footprints still was there.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This is a hell of a town,&quot; said the conductor
cheerfully.</p>

<p class="indent">I waited for an explanation. It came.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, I went to a nigger-minstrel show
here the other night. A mountaineer in the
gallery shot a nigger and a white man dead
in the aisle, but the band struck up &#39;Dixie,&#39;
and the show never stopped. But one man left
the house and that was Bones. They found
him at the hotel, but he refused to go back.
&#39;I can&#39;t be funny in that place,&#39; he said.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>[pg&nbsp;4]</span>
Now the curious thing is that each one of
those three, the slayer and the slain&mdash;the
Saxon through the arrogance of race, the African
through the imitative faculty that has
given him something of that same arrogance
toward the people of other lands&mdash;felt himself
the superior of any Oriental with a yellow
skin. And now when I think of the exquisite
courtesy and ceremony and gentle politeness
in this land, I smile; then I think of the bearing
of the man toward the woman of this land,
and the bearing of the man&mdash;even the mountaineer&mdash;toward
the woman in our own land,
and the place the woman holds in each&mdash;and
the smile passes.</p>

<p class="indent">Along that old wilderness trail I went across
the Ohio, through prairie lands, across the rich
fields of Iowa, the plains of Nebraska, over
the Rockies, and down into the great deserts
that stretch to the Sierras. Along went others
who were concerned in that trail: three Japanese
students hurrying home from England,
France, and Germany, bits of that network of
eager investigation that Japan has spread over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>[pg&nbsp;5]</span>
the globe&mdash;quiet, unobtrusive little fellows
who rushed for papers at every station to see
news of the war; three Americans on the way
to the Philippines for the Government; an
English Major of Infantry and an English
Captain of Cavalry and a pretty English girl;
and two who in that trail had no interest&mdash;two
newspaper men from France. I have been told
that the only two seven-masted vessels in the
world collided one night in mid-ocean. Well,
these sons of France&mdash;the only ones on their
mission, perhaps, in broad America&mdash;collided
not only on the same train, the same sleeper, and
the same section, I was told, but both were gazetted
for the same lower berth. Each asserted
his claim with a politeness that became gesticulatory
and vociferous. Conductor, brakeman,
and porter came to the scene of action. Nobody
could settle the dispute, so the correspondents
exchanged cards, claimed Gallic satisfaction
mutually, and requested the conductor to
stop the train and let them get off and fight.
The conductor explained that, much as he personally
would like to see the scrap, the law of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>[pg&nbsp;6]</span>
the land and the speed of the Overland Limited
made tarrying impossible. Without rapiers
I have often wondered how those two
gentlemen of France would have drawn each
other&#39;s blood. Each still refused to take the
upper berth, but next day they were friends,
and came over sea practically arm and arm on
shipboard, and arm and arm they practically
are in Japan to-day.</p>

<p class="indent">Through the stamping grounds of Wister&#39;s
&quot;Virginian&quot; and other men of fact and fiction
in the West, the trail led&mdash;through barren
wastes with nothing alive in sight except an
occasional flock of gray, starved sheep with a
lonely herder and his sheep-dog watching us
pass, while a blue-eyed frontiersman gave me
more reasons for race arrogance with his tales
of Western ethics in the old days: How men
trusted each other and were not deceived in
friendship and in trade; how they sacrificed
themselves for each other without regret, and
no wish for reward, and honored and protected
women always.</p>

<p class="indent">Then forty miles of snowsheds over the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>[pg&nbsp;7]</span>
Sierras, and the trail dropped sheer into the
dewy green of flowers, gardens, and fruit-tree
blossoms, where the grass was lush, cattle and
sheep were fat, and the fields looked like rich
orchards&mdash;to end in the last camp of the Saxon,
San Francisco&mdash;where the heathen Chinee
walks the streets, where Robert Louis Stevenson&#39;s
bronze galley has motionless sails set to
the winds that blow through a little park,
where Bret Harte&#39;s memory is soon to be honored
in a similar way, and where a man claimed
that the civilization of the trail had leaped in
one bound from Chicago to the Pacific Coast.
And I wondered what the intermediate Saxons,
over whose heads that leap was made, would
have to say in answer.</p>

<p class="indent">He had sailed one wide ocean&mdash;this Saxon&mdash;the
other and wider one was by comparison
a child&#39;s play on a mill-pond with a boat of his
own making, and over it I followed him on.</p>

<p class="indent">On the dock two days later I saw my first
crowd of Japanese, in Saxon clothes, waving
flags, and giving Saxon yells to their countrymen
who were going home to fight. After that,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>[pg&nbsp;8]</span>
but for an occasional march of those same countrymen
on the steerage deck to the measure of
a war-song, no more tidings, or rumors or suggestions
of war.</p>

<p class="indent">Seven days later, long, slowly rising slopes
of mountains veiled in mist came in view, and
we saw waves of many colors washing the feet
of newest America, where the Saxon has
pitched his latest but not his most Eastern&mdash;as
I must say now&mdash;camp; and where he is
patching a human crazy quilt of skins from
China, Japan, Portugal, America, England,
Africa. The patching of it goes swiftly, but
there will be one hole in the quilt that will
never be filled again on this earth, for the Hawaiian
is going&mdash;as he himself says, he is
&quot;pau,&quot; which in English means finished, done
for, doomed. Now girls who are three-quarters
Saxon dance the hula-hula for tourists, and
but for a movement of their feet, it is the
dance of the East wretchedly and vulgarly
done, and the spectator would wipe away, if
he could, every memory but the wailing song
of the woman with the guitar&mdash;a song which
to my ear had no more connection with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[pg&nbsp;9]</span>
dance than a cradle song could have with a
bacchanalian orgy.</p>

<p class="indent">At a big white hotel that night hundreds of
people sat in a brilliantly lighted open-air garden
with a stone floor and stone balustrade, and
heard an Hawaiian band of many nationalities
play the tunes of all nations, and two
women give vent to that adaptation of the
Methodist hymn that passes for an Hawaiian
song.</p>

<p class="indent">Every possible human mixture of blood I
had seen that day, I fancied, but of the morals
that caused the mixture I will not speak, for
the looseness of them is climatic and easily explained.
I am told that after five or six years
the molecules even in the granite of the New
England character begin to get restless. Still
there seems to be hope on the horizon.</p>

<p class="indent">At midnight a bibulous gentleman descended
from a hack in front of the hotel.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Roderick Random,&quot; he said to his Portuguese
driver, &quot;this is a bum-m town,&quot; spelling
the word out thickly. Roderick smiled with
polite acquiescence. The bibulous gentleman
spoke likewise to the watchman at the door.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg&nbsp;10]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Quite right, sir,&quot; said the watchman.</p>

<p class="indent">The elevator got the same blighting criticism
from the visitor, whose good-night to the
clerk at the desk still was:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This is a bum-m town.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The clerk, too, agreed, and the man turned
away in disgust.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can&#39;t get an argument out of anybody on
that point,&quot; he said&mdash;all of which would seem
to cast some doubt on the public late-at-night
flaunting of vice in Honolulu.</p>

<p class="indent">Two pictures only I carried away of the
many I hoped to see&mdash;the Hawaiian swimmers,
bronzed and perfect as statues, who floated out
to meet us and dive for coins, and a crowd of
little yellow fellows, each on the swaying
branch of the monkey-pod tree, black hair
shaking in the wind, white teeth flashing, faces
merry, and mouths stretched wide with song.</p>

<p class="indent">Thence eleven long, long days to that sunset
entrance into the Land of the Rising Sun&mdash;where
Perry came to throw open to the world
the long-shut sea portals of Japan.</p>

<p class="indent">The Japanese way of revealing heart-beats
is not the way of the Occidental world, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[pg&nbsp;11]</span>
seeing no signs of war, this correspondent, at
least, straightway forgot the mission on which
he had come, and straightway was turned into
an eager student of a people and a land which
since childhood he had yearned to see.</p>

<p class="indent">On a certain bluff sits a certain tea-house&mdash;you
can see it from the deck of the ship. It is
the tea-house of One Hundred and One Steps,
and the mistress of it is O-kin-san, daughter of
the man who was mayor when Perry opened
the sea portals at the mouth of the cannon,
whose guest Perry was, and whose friend.</p>

<p class="indent">O-kin-san&#39;s people lost their money once,
and she opened the tea-house, as the American
girl under similar circumstances would have
taken to the typewriter and the stenographer&#39;s
pen. The house has a year of life for almost
every one of the steps that mount to it, which is
ancient life for Japan, where fires make an infant
life of three years for the average Japanese
home. The tea-girls are O-kin-san&#39;s own
kin. Everything under her roof is blameless,
and the women of any home in any land can
be taken there fearlessly.</p>

<p class="indent">An American enthusiast&mdash;a voluntary exile,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg&nbsp;12]</span>
whom I met later&mdash;told me that O-kin-san&#39;s
Japanese was as good as could be found in the
empire; that her husband was one of the best-educated
men he had ever known, and had been
a great help and inspiration to Lafcadio Hearn.
There were all the pretty courtesies, the pretty
ceremonies, and the gentle kindness of which
the world has read.</p>

<p class="indent">After tea and sake and little Japanese cakes
and peanuts, thence straightway to Tokio,
whence the soldiers went to the front and the
unknown correspondent was going, at that
time, to an unknown destination in an unknown
time. It is an hour between little
patches of half-drowned rice bulbs, cottages
thatched with rice straw, with green things
growing on the roof, and little gardens laid
out with an art minute and exquisite, blossoming
trees of wild cherry, that beloved symbol
of Japanese bravery because it dares to spread
its petals under falling snow, dashed here and
there with the red camellia that is unlucky because
it drops its blossom whole and suggests
the time when the Japanese head might fall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg&nbsp;13]</span>
for a slight offence; between little hills overspread
with pine trees, and little leafless saplings
that help so much to give the delicate,
airy quality that characterizes the landscape of
Japan. At every station was a hurrying throng
of men, women, and children who clicked the
stone pavements on xylophones with a music
that some writer with the tympanum of a
blacksmith characterized as a clatter. These
getas are often selected, I am told, to suit the
individual ear.</p>

<p class="indent">At Tokio outward evidences of war were as
meagre as ever. But to that lack, the answer
is, &quot;It is not the Japanese custom.&quot; I am told
that the night war was declared the Japanese
went to bed, but about every bulletin board
there is now always an eager crowd of watchers.
The shout of &quot;Nippon banzai!&quot; from
the foreigner, which means &quot;Good luck to
Japan,&quot; always gets a grateful response from
the child in the street, the coolie with his ricksha,
policeman on his beat, or the Japanese
gentleman in his carriage.</p>

<p class="indent">And then the stories I heard of the devotion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg&nbsp;14]</span>
and sacrifice of the people who are left at
home! The women let their hair go undressed
once a month that they may contribute each
month the price of the dressing&mdash;five sen. A
gentleman discovered that every servant in his
household, from butler down, was contributing
a certain amount of his wages each month,
and in consequence offered to raise wages just
the amount each servant was giving away.
The answer was:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sir, we cannot allow that; it is an honor
for us to give, and it would be you who would
be doing our duty for us to Japan.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A Japanese lady apologized profusely for
being late at dinner. She had been to the station
to see her son off for the front, where
already were three of her sons.</p>

<p class="indent">Said another straightway:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How fortunate to be able to give four sons
to Japan!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In a tea-house I saw an old woman with
blackened teeth, a servant, who bore herself
proudly, and who, too, was honored because
she had sent four sons to the Yalu. Hundreds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg&nbsp;15]</span>
and thousands of families are denying themselves
one meal a day that they may give more
to their country. And one rich merchant, who
has already given 100,000 yen, has himself cut
off one meal, and declares that he will if necessary
live on one the rest of his life for the sake
of Japan.</p>

<p class="indent">There is a war play on the boards of one
theatre. The heroine, a wife, says that her unborn
child in a crisis like this must be a man-child,
and that he shall be reared a soldier.
To provide means, she will herself, if necessary,
go to the yoshiwara.</p>

<p class="indent">On every gateway is posted a red slab where
a man has gone to the war, marked &quot;Gone to
the front&quot;&mdash;to be supplanted with a black one&mdash;&quot;Bravery
forever&quot;&mdash;should he be brought
home dead. And when he is brought home
dead his body is received at the station by his
kin with proud faces and no tears. The Roman
mother has come back to earth again, and it is
the Japanese mother who makes Japan the high
priestess of patriotism among the nations of the
world. In that patriotism are the passionate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg&nbsp;16]</span>
fealty of the subject to his king, the love of a
republic for its flag, and straightway the
stranger feels that were the Mikado no more
and Japan a republic to-morrow, this war
would go on just as it would had the Japanese
only this Mikado and no land that he
could call his own. The soldier at the front
or on the seas will give no better account of
himself than the man, woman, or child who is
left at home, and a national spirit like this is
too beautiful to be lost.</p>

<p class="indent">Here forks the trail of the Saxon. One
branch goes straight to the Philippines. The
other splits here into a thousand tiny paths&mdash;where
railway coach has supplanted the palanquin,
battle-ship the war-junk, electricity the
pictured lantern; where factory chimneys
smoke and the Japanese seems prouder of his
commerce than of his art and his exquisite
manners; where the boycott has started, and
even the word strike&mdash;&quot;strikey, strikey&quot; it
sounds&mdash;has become the refrain of a song.
How shallow, after all, the tiny paths are, no
man may know; for who can penetrate the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg&nbsp;17]</span>
mystery of Japanese life and character&mdash;a
mystery that has been deepening for a thousand
years. Here is the chief lodge of the
Order of Sealed Lips the world over, and every
man, woman, and child in the empire seems
born a life-member. It may be Japan who
will clasp the hands of the Saxon across this
Far East. And yet who knows? Were
Mother Nature to found a national museum
of the curiosities in plant and tree that humanity
has wrested from her, she would give the
star-chamber to Japan. This is due, maybe,
to the Japanese love of plant and tree and the
limitations of space that forbid to both full
height. Give the little island room, and the
dwarf pine and fruit-tree may become in time,
perhaps, as great a curiosity here as elsewhere in
the world. What will she do&mdash;when she gets
the room? The Saxon hands may never meet.
Japan Saxonized may, in turn, Saxonize China
and throw the tide that has moved east and
west, some day, west and east again.</p>

<h2>II</h2>

<p class="h2">HARDSHIPS OF THE CAMPAIGN</p>

<p class="indent">I have taken to the big hills in some despair
and to rest from the hardships of this campaign.
Truly the life of the war correspondent
is hard in Japan.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">The Happy Exile left America three years
ago with a Puck-purpose of girdling the world.
He got no farther than Japan, and here most
likely he will rest. He is a big man and a
gentle one, and I have seen his six-feet-two
frame quiver with joy like jelly as we rickshawed
through the streets, he pointing out to
me meanwhile little bits of color and life on
either side. I have heard him when the dusk
rushes seaward muttering half-unconsciously to
himself:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m so glad I am here. I&#39;m <i>so</i> glad I am
here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It is the &quot;lust of the eye&quot; he says, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg&nbsp;19]</span>
lust is as fierce now as on the day he landed&mdash;which
is rare; for the man who has been here
before has genuine envy of the eye that sees
Japan for the first time. I have watched the
man who has seen, showing around the man
who has not, with a look of benevolent sympathy
and reflected joy such as one may catch
on the face of a middle-aged gentleman in the
theatre who is watching the keen delight of
some youth to whom he is showing the sights
of a great city. The Happy Exile was a
painter once, but he came, saw Japanese art,
and was conquered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have never touched brush to canvas
again. What&#39;s the use? Why, I can&#39;t even
draw their characters. Other nations draw this
way&quot;; he worked his hands and fingers from
the wrist and elbow. &quot;The Japanese learn,
drawing their characters in childhood, to use
the whole arm. Imagine the breadth and
sweep of movement!&quot; The Happy Exile
threw up both hands. &quot;It&#39;s of no use, at least
not for me. I have given it up.&quot; So he studies
life and Myth in Japan, collects curios, silks,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg&nbsp;20]</span>
and satsuma, writes a little, dreams a good
deal, and gives up his whole heart to his eye.
The Happy Exile has a friend, a Japanese
friend, who is one of the new types that one
finds now in New Japan. His name is Amenemori.
He is the husband of O-kin-san, mistress
of the tea-house of One Hundred and One
Steps, who herself can talk with her guests
from all parts of the world in five languages
and is an authority on tea-ceremonies and a
poetess of some distinction. Amenemori is not
only a linguist, but a scholar. He has English,
French, German, Italian and Russian at his
command, and more. Not long ago a wandering
Indian priest came to Yokohama and could
talk with nobody. Amenemori tried him in
Japanese, Korean, and Chinese without success,
and the two finally found communication in
Sanscrit. One of Lafcadio Hearn&#39;s books is
dedicated to him, and through him that author
acquired the widest acquaintance with old Japanese
poetry yet attained by any foreigner.
Illustrating the change that has taken place in
an ancient Japanese word to its modern form,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg&nbsp;21]</span>
he quotes Chaucer and the modern equivalent
for the Chaucerian phrase!</p>

<p class="indent">But the lust of the eye! Well, the eye is
all the stranger has. The work his brain does
has little value. No matter what he may learn
one day, that thing next day he may have to
unlearn. The eye alone gives pleasure&mdash;to the
color-loving, picture-loving brain&mdash;delight unmeasurable:
but the eye does not understand.
The ear hears strange new calls and sounds&mdash;unmusical
except in the xylophonic click of
wooden getas, the plaintive cry of the blind
masseur, and in the national anthem, which is
moving beyond words; and the ear, too, does
not understand. But the nose&mdash;&quot;that despised
poet of the senses&quot;&mdash;his faculty holds firm the
world over. In Tokio he puts on sable trappings
at sunset that would gloom the dark hour
before dawn. You will get used to it, you are
told, and that frightens you, for you don&#39;t want
to get used to it. You should go to China,
is the comfort you get, and in that suggestion
is no comfort. Straightway you swear, and
boldly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg&nbsp;22]</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">No call of the East for me,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Till the stink of the East be dead.</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">That is why a man who comes from a land
where he can fill both lungs fearlessly and
stoop to drink from any stream that his feet
may cross must go down now and then to the
sea or turn his face firmly to the hills.</p>

<p class="indent">From Yokohama the little coaches start
slowly for the country&mdash;so slowly that, like
Artemus Ward, you wonder if it wouldn&#39;t be
wise sometimes to put the cow-catcher on behind.
There is the charm of thatched cottage,
green squares of wind-shaken barley, long
waving grass and little hills, pine-crowned;
but by and by your heart gets wrung with
sympathy for Mother Nature. Every blade of
grass, every rush, every little tree seems to have
been let grow only through human sufferance.
It is as though a solemn court-martial had been
held on the life of everything that grew not
to make feed for man and man alone, for nowhere
are there sheep, cattle, horses, and rarely
even a dog. Here and there the little hills
have been cut down sheer, that the rice squares
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg&nbsp;23]</span>
might burrow under them. The face of the
earth looked terribly man-handled, but the effect
was still lovely. The little rows of pines
on the hills seemed to have been so left that
no rearrangement would have been necessary
to transfer them to canvas, and even the crown
of a pine sloping from a group of its fellows
seemed to have been spared for no other reason
than picturesque effect. Perhaps for that reason
Nature herself seemed to enter no protest.
It was as though she said:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know your needs, my children, you do
only what you must; you know just what you
do, and I forgive you, for you rob me with
loving hands. A little farther on is my refuge.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And a little farther on was her refuge in
the big volcanic hills, guarded by great white
solemn Fuji, where birds sing and torrents lash
with swirling foam and a great roar through
deep gorges or drop down in white cataracts
through masses of trembling green. But you
have an hour first in an electric car, with a bell
ringing always to keep multitudinous children
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg&nbsp;24]</span>
from the track, along the old road that the
Daimios took in their semi-annual trip from
their up-country estates to Tokio and back again&mdash;the
Daimios&mdash;gorgeously arrayed, in palanquins,
with their retinues following, while the
people kept their foreheads to the earth and
dared not raise their eyes&mdash;honors which they
no longer pay even to the great Mikado. It
seemed a sacrilege. Then an hour in a rickshaw&mdash;two
pushers behind, up a deep winding
gorge from which comes the wild call of free
rushing water, and you are in the untainted air
of the primeval Cumberland.</p>

<p class="indent">It is pleasant to be welcomed by a host and
a host of servants bent at right angles with
courtesy&mdash;a courtesy that follows you everywhere.
Ten minutes later, as I stepped from
behind the screen&mdash;the ever-present screen&mdash;in
my room, the Maid of Miyanoshita&mdash;another
new type in New Japan&mdash;stood bowing at my
door, and I am afraid I gave her scant greeting.
I had read of feminine service, and Saxon-like
I was fearsome; but how could I know that she
was the daughter of mine host&mdash;a man more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg&nbsp;25]</span>
well-to-do than most of his guests, who include
the princes and princesses at times of the royal
household&mdash;and that she had come merely to
welcome me? And how could I know that she
was a lady, as I understand the word, for how
can a stranger know who is gentlewoman or
gentleman in a land where gentle manners are
universal, when he has not learned the distinctions
of dress and when face and voice give no
unerring guidance in any land? Later I was
sorry and tried to make good, but here lack of
breeding is condoned in a barbarian. Straightway
one little maid came in to build a fire,
while another swiftly unpacked my bag, laid
out evening clothes, and played the part of a
blind automatic valet. Embarrassment, even
consciousness, fled like a flash, as it must flee
with any man who is not blackguard or fool,
and I am thinking now how foreigners have
lied about the women of Japan.</p>

<p class="indent">I want no better dinner than the one that
came later, and I went to sleep with mountain
air coming like balm through the windows, the
music of hushed falling water somewhere, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[pg&nbsp;26]</span>
a cherry tree full-blown shining like a great
white, low star at the foot of a mountain
that rose darkly toward the stars. This life
of the war correspondent in Japan&mdash;truly &#39;tis
hard!</p>

<p class="indent">Next morning I heard the scampering of
many feet and much laughter in the hallways,
and I thought there were children out there
playing games. It was those brown little
chambermaids hard at work. I wonder whence
comes the perpetual sunny cheer of these little
people; whether it be simple temperament or
ages of philosophy&mdash;or both.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have your troubles,&quot; they say, &quot;therefore
I must not burden you with mine.&quot; And
a man will tell you, with a smile, of some
misfortune that is almost breaking his heart.</p>

<p class="indent">The little maid who had unpacked my bag
brought breakfast to me, and I could see that
I was invested with some interest which was
not at all apparent the night before. Presently
it came out:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are going to Korea?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I am going to Korea.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg&nbsp;27]</span>
&quot;I want to go to Korea, but they won&#39;t
let girls go.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why do you want to go to Korea?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For the first time I saw Japanese eyes flash,
and her answer came like the crack of a whip:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To fight!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Among the thousands of applications, many
of them written in blood, which the war office
has received from men who are anxious to go
to the front, is one from just such a girl. In
her letter she said that she was the last of an
old Samurai family. Her father was killed in
the war with China; her only brother died during
the Boxer troubles. She begged to be allowed
to take the place in the ranks which had
always belonged to her family. She could
shoot, she said, and ride; and it would be a
lasting disgrace if her family name should be
missing from the rolls, where it has had an
honored place for centuries, now that her country
and her Emperor are in such sore need.</p>

<p class="indent">After breakfast I climbed the mountain that
I could see from my window&mdash;it ran not so
high by day&mdash;and up there great Fuji was gracious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[pg&nbsp;28]</span>
enough for one fleeting moment to throw
back the gray mantle of a cloud and bare for
me for the first time his sacred white head.
Coming down, I found a pretty story of American
Chivalry and the Maid of Miyanoshita.
There was a man here whose nationality will
not be mentioned, and a big young American
who hasn&#39;t lost the traditions of his race and
country. With the lack of understanding that
is not uncommon with foreigners during their
first days in Japan, this particular foreigner
said something to the little lady that he would
not have said under similar circumstances at
home. Now, just behind the hotel are two
foaming cascades which drop into a clear pool
of water wherein sport many fishes big and
little&mdash;green, silver, gold, or mottled with
white and scarlet&mdash;which it is the pleasure of
the guests to feed. A few minutes later there
was a commotion on the margin of the pond,
and those fishes, gathering as usual for biscuit
and sugar, got a surprise. The American had
invited the other foreigner out there, and the
two were having a mighty mill. After a nice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg&nbsp;29]</span>
solar-plexus landing, the American caught up
his opponent and threw him bodily into the
fish-pond. The man disappeared next morning
by the first train. Wallah, but it was grateful
to the soul&mdash;striking a Saxon trail like that!</p>

<p class="indent">After tiffin I was struggling with Japanese
idioms in a guide-book. &quot;I will be glad to
help you,&quot; said the Maid of Miyanoshita.</p>

<p class="indent">She had gone to school in a convent in Tokio.
Only Japanese girls and a few Eurasians,
girls whose fathers are foreigners, were students,
and they were allowed to speak only
French. There she was taught to read and
write English. To speak it, she had learned
only from guests at the hotel.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; I said, &quot;if the Japanese in this
book is as bad as the English, I don&#39;t think I
want to learn it.&quot; She looked at the book.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It iss bad,&quot; she said; &quot;there are words here
you must not use.&quot; (It is impossible to give
dialectic form to her quaint variations from
normal pronunciation.) By and by we found
an example.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; she said, &quot;sukimas means &#39;I like.&#39;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg&nbsp;30]</span>
I like flowers, birds, and so on, but you must
not use that&mdash;&quot; with one pointed finger on a
word that I proceeded straightway to damn
forever.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is the proper word for <i>that</i> word?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ai suru,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what does that mean?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A vertical line of mental effort broke the
smoothness of her forehead.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It iss <i>deeper</i> than &#39;like.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh,&quot; I said. She continued her mental
search for an English equivalent. I tried to
help.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Love?&quot; I ventured.</p>

<p class="indent">With straight eyes she met purely impersonal
inquiry with response even more impersonal.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yess,&quot; she said.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">That afternoon I walked farther up the
gorge, past curio shops, with the river roaring
far beneath and water tumbling from far
above, and I turned in for a moment where
the word &quot;Archery&quot; curved in big letters over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[pg&nbsp;31]</span>
a doorway, to see an old chap put eight arrows
out of ten in a small target a hundred feet
away, and triumphantly shout:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Russian!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And then on past tea-houses and workshops
and rice-mills with undershot water-wheels
such as I had left in the Cumberland Mountains.
In a rice square below and beyond me
three little girls were playing. When they saw
me they ran toward the road, stooping now and
then to pick up something as they ran. The
littlest one held up to me a bunch of blue flowers.
I was thrilled; here I thought is where I
get the courtesy of the land even from the peasant
class and untainted by the rude manners of
the Saxon and his Caucasian kind. I took off
my hat.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Arigato,&quot; I said, which means &quot;Thank
you.&quot; Out came the mite&#39;s chubby hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shinga!&quot; she said, &quot;mucha shinga!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Now I have not been able to find anyone
who knows what &quot;shinga&quot; means except the
little highway robbers who held me up in the
road and made it plain by signs. I went down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg&nbsp;32]</span>
into my pocket for a coin. Up stepped number
two of the little hold-ups, with number
three in close support; but I was too disappointed
and sore, and I declined. Those three
little ones followed me half a mile and up
many score of steep steps to a temple in a grove,
still proffering flowers and saying,</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shinga.&quot; It was sad.</p>

<p class="indent">Going back I met another mite of a girl in
a many-colored kimono. She said something.
I am afraid I glowered, but she said it again,
with a bow and a smile, and it was&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Konnichi-wa!&quot; which means &quot;Good-day.&quot;
Then wasn&#39;t I sorry! This was the
real thing. I took off my hat, and then and
there this little maid and I exchanged elaborate
Oriental ceremonies in the middle of the
road, concluding with three right-angle bows of
farewell, each saying three times that very
beautiful Japanese good-by,</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sayonara.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">I went on cheered and thinking. This was
Old and New Japan, the lingering beauty of
one, the trail of the tourist over the other, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[pg&nbsp;33]</span>
this was Japan in general. When you are
looking for a thing you get something else;
when you look for something else you get what
you were looking for. The trouble was that
in neither case should I have been surprised,
for the Japanese even say,</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is not surprising if the surprising does
not surprise,&quot; which must be thought about for
a while. And then again, What&#39;s the odds,
no matter what happens.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shikata ga nai,&quot; says the Japanese; &quot;It
can&#39;t be helped&quot;&mdash;a fatalistic bit of philosophy
that may play an important part on many
future battle-fields.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">The Little Maid of Miyanoshita and I were
tossing bits of cracker to the gold-fishes in the
pond, and each bit made a breaking, flashing
rainbow as they rushed for it in a writhing
heap. She had never been to America nor to
England.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wouldn&#39;t you like to go?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Verry much,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[pg&nbsp;34]</span>
&quot;Well, aren&#39;t you going some day?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hope so, but&mdash;&quot; she paused; &quot;if I wore
these clothes the people would follow me about
the streets. If I wore European clothes, I
would look like&mdash;what you say&mdash;a fright.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never!&quot; Again she shook her head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yess, yess I would.&quot; And the pity of it
is I am afraid she was right.</p>

<p class="indent">The Little Maid did not walk the hills
much.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Japanese men do not like for women to go
about much,&quot; she said. &quot;My uncle does not
like that I go about alone, but my father he
does not care. He has been in America.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is perfectly safe?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, perrfectly safe. Is it not so in America?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, no, not always; at least not in the
South, where I come from.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She did not ask why, though I should not
have been surprised to learn that she knew,
and I did not explain.</p>

<p class="indent">She was very fond of Schiller, she said, and
she had read many American and English novels.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[pg&nbsp;35]</span>
She liked &quot;The Crisis&quot; very much&mdash;she
did not mention others&mdash;though she liked better
the novels that were written by women.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because you understand them better?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not only that,&quot; she said slowly, &quot;but I
think that men who write novels try to make
the women happy, and the women who write
novels do not do that so much; and I think the
women must be nearer the truth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She turned suddenly on me:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>You</i> have written a book.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Guilty,&quot; I said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what does that mean?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It means that I have,&quot; I said lamely. We
talked international differences.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;American women use very many pins, is it
not true?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think it is true,&quot; I said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We do not,&quot; she said; &quot;we use what you
call&quot;&mdash;with her fingers on a little cord at the
breast of her kimono&mdash;&quot;strings. But,&quot; she
added suddenly, &quot;an American says to me that
I must not speak of such things.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tut!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[pg&nbsp;36]</span>
&quot;Well,&quot; she said, &quot;I do not see anything
wrong.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In America, I explained, we put the woman
in a high place and looked up at her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is it not so in Japan?&quot; I said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; she said simply, &quot;it is not so in Japan.&quot;
She thought a while. &quot;That must be
very nice for the woman in America,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think it is,&quot; I said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But then,&quot; she said, to explain the mystery,
they are so well ed-u-ca-ted.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I don&#39;t think it is because they are
so well educated,&quot; I said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then they are worthy,&quot; said the Little
Maid.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">I have been to Big Hell&mdash;a climb of some
three thousand feet past rice squares and barley
fields and little forests of bamboo trees, where
on a God-forsaken mountain top sulphurous
smoke belches into the clouds that drift about
it. Now smoke suggests human habitation,
human food, and human comfort, and that
smoke swirling up there gave the spot a loneliness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg&nbsp;37]</span>
unspeakable. Under you the gray earth
was hot, here and there were springs of boiling
water, and the ashy crust crackled under your
feet. Around the crest we went, and down
through a forest of big trees left standing because
the place was a royal preserve. The absence
of animals, tame or wild, has constantly
depressed me ever since I have been in Japan.
Even up there in the hills I had seen nothing
hopping, crawling, or climbing by the roadside
or in the woods, and I could see nothing now.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is there nothing wild up here?&quot; I said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; said the guide, &quot;there are deer
and monkeys.&quot; If he had said there were dodos
I could have been no more surprised; but
to this day I have seen nothing in freedom
except a few birds in the air.</p>

<p class="indent">By and by a thatched roof came in view.
The path led sharply around one corner of the
house and I was brought up with a gasp. I
had read and heard much about bathing customs
in Japan. The government has tried, I
believe, to legislate into the people Occidental
ideas of modesty. One regulation provided
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg&nbsp;38]</span>
that the sexes should be separated. They were
separated&mdash;by a bamboo rod floating on the
water. Another time it was announced that
bathing trunks must be worn at a certain place
by the sea. One old chap issued leisurely from
his house on the hill-side and stalked down
without clothes, swinging his trunks in his
hand. After he got into the water he put the
trunks on, and as soon as he came out he took
them off again and stalked home swinging
them as before.</p>

<p class="indent">Well, there they were, old and young and
of both sexes, and it was apparent that the
regulations of the bamboo rod and the bathing
trunks had not reached that high. It was a
natural Turkish bath-house, and it seems that
the farmers around Big Hell furnish a certain
amount of produce each year to the proprietor
for the privilege of hot baths, and when work
is slack they go up there&mdash;husbands and wives,
sons and daughters&mdash;and stay for days. Apparently
work was slack just then. The bath,
some ten feet square, and sunk in the floor, was
screened from the gaze of the passing pedestrian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[pg&nbsp;39]</span>
and the coldness of the outer air merely
by slender bamboo rods, some eighteen inches
apart. It was full to the brim.</p>

<p class="indent">That night an Englishman seemed greatly
taken with Big Hell.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Most extraordinary!&quot; he said. &quot;Do you
know, they never minded us at all&mdash;not at
all. A chap had a camera, and one dear old
lady actually stood upright when he was taking
a picture. They asked me to come in, and
I really think I would, but&mdash;gad, you know,
there wasn&#39;t any room.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The key-note of this symphony of ills will
not be sounded here.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">She could play the koto (the harp), and the
piano a little&mdash;could the Maid of Miyanoshita.
She would play neither for me, but that afternoon
she would take me, she said, to hear a
friend play the koto&mdash;an elderly friend, whom
she called, she said, her aunt. Later, she said
she had asked another gentleman also. Now
when I spoke once of the musical click of the
getas, the Happy Exile had told me that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg&nbsp;40]</span>
wearers often chose them, taking only such
pairs as pleased the individual ear. The statement
has since been much laughed at, so I asked
the Maid of Miyanoshita for confirmation.
She at least did not choose her getas for their
sound.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But,&quot; she said, &quot;the Japanese say the
getas go&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;&#39;Kara-ko, kara-ko, kara-ko!&#39;&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">The notes she gave were the notes I had
heard on the stone platforms of every station
between Tokio and Yokohama, and going
straightway to the piano I found those notes
to be F and D in the scale of F Minor. Let
the laugh proceed. The Happy Exile possibly
might say that those notes were the prominent
ones in some old national song, and that the
geta-makers had been unconsciously reproducing
them ever since.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">It was raining. Alack and alas! the Little
Maid carried an American umbrella&mdash;impious
trail of the Saxon! while the Other Man and
I bore picturesque Japanese ones that would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg&nbsp;41]</span>
have given the crowning touch to her, but
looked simply ridiculous over us. Thus we
went to meet the exquisite courtesy and genuine
kindness of a real Japanese home.</p>

<p class="indent">Two kotos were played for us, while the
players sang &quot;Wind Among the Pines,&quot; and
the tale of the fairies who fell in love with
the fisherman.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you like Japanese music?&quot; said the
Little Maid to the Other Man.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; he said promptly, lying like a gentleman.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t you think it is rather monotonous?&quot;
she asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well&mdash;um&mdash;um. Don&#39;t you like Japanese
music?&quot; he said, taking refuge.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; she said, &quot;I like your music better,
I think. It is more lively and has more variety.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then we had tea, and after tea of the kind
usually served in Japan, the husband, a fierce
Samurai in the pictures he showed us, but now
a genial, broad-smiling doctor of the old Japanese
school, insisted that we should take bowls
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg&nbsp;42]</span>
of powdered tea which he prepared with his
own hands. In the drinking of this the Little
Maid instructed us. We were to take the bowl,
the left hand underneath, the fingers of the
right hand clasped about it, lift it to the forehead,
a movement of unspoken thanks, and
very gently, so as not to suggest that the tea
needed to be dissolved, were to roll the tea
around in the bowl three times and then take
one drink&mdash;making much noise, meanwhile,
with the lips to show how much we enjoyed it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is very vulgar in your country,&quot; interrupted
the Little Maid, &quot;is it not so?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; I said, &quot;lots of people do it, but
not for the reason of courtesy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">We were to roll it around three times more,
and then drink again; three times more, and a
third drink, leaving this time but a little,
which, without being rolled around again, was
to be drunk at a swallow&mdash;three drinks and
one swallow to the bowl. O-kin-san says that
this last swallow should be only the foam,
which must be drunk to show that the tea is
so good that the guest must have even the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>[pg&nbsp;43]</span>
foam; and that not until then does the noise
of appreciation come, and then only because
the foam cannot be drunk without noise. It
was well. We exchanged autographs and
cards. With the kind permission of the Little
Maid&#39;s aunt we took pictures of the interior,
and then with much bowing and many &quot;sayonaras&quot;
we passed out under the cherry trees.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We say &#39;Good-morning,&#39;&quot; said the Little
Maid, explaining the courtesies of Japanese
greeting and good-by, &quot;and we bow; and we
say &#39;It is a long while since I have seen you,&#39;
or &#39;It is a fine day,&#39; and we bow again. At the
end of each sentence you must bow, and it is
the same when you say good-by.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Before I learned that the Mikado had sent
a general edict through the land that all foreigners
in Japan were to be treated with particular
consideration while this war is going on&mdash;thus
making it safer for the tourist now in
this country than it ever has been or will be,
perhaps, for a long time&mdash;I had been greatly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[pg&nbsp;44]</span>
impressed by the absence of all signs of disorder,
street quarrels, loud talking, and by the
fact that in Tokio, one of the largest cities in
the world, one could go about day or night in
perfect safety. I told this to the Maid of
Miyanoshita.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So desuka,&quot; she said without surprise, and
that means &quot;Indeed.&quot; And when she said
later that there were many Japanese novelists,
but they did not write love stories, I was reminded
further that I had seen no man in Japan
turn his head to look at a woman who had
passed him&mdash;no exchange of glances, no street
gallantry at all.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The song of the &#39;Goo-goo Eyes,&#39;&quot; I said,
&quot;would never have been written in Japan.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What iss &#39;Goo-goo Eyes&#39;?&quot; said the Little
Maid, mystified.</p>

<p class="indent">Then had I trouble&mdash;but I must have made
it clear at last.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps the Japanese girl does not want
to be seen&mdash;looking.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, you mean that she may look, but the
foreigner doesn&#39;t see it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>[pg&nbsp;45]</span>
&quot;Well, we are all human. That is very
frank, is it not?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was frank&mdash;very frank&mdash;and of an innocence
not to be misunderstood save by a fool.
Then I got a degree.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I am always frank with you, for if
you are what you say &#39;guilty,&#39; I think you
must understand. I call you to myself a Doctor
of Humanity.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Wallah, but the life is hard!</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">By and by this remarkable Little Maid went
on:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Japanese may be what you call in
love, but they must not tell it&mdash;must not even
show it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not even the men?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, not even the men. Is it not so in your
country?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">I laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, it is not so in my country.&quot; I found
myself suddenly imitating her own slow speech.
&quot;That&#39;s the first thing the man in my country
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[pg&nbsp;46]</span>
does. Sometimes he tells it, even when he
can&#39;t ask the girl to marry him, and sometimes
they even tell it over there when they don&#39;t
mean it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So desuka!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They call that &#39;flirting.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I know &#39;flirting,&#39;&quot; said the Little
Maid.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is not a very nice word,&quot; I said. &quot;There
is no flirting in Japan?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is no chance. Parents and friends
make marriage in Japan.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They don&#39;t marry for love?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is as in France&mdash;not for love. And in
America?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, we don&#39;t think it nice for people
to marry unless they are in love.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So desuka,&quot; she said, which still means
&quot;Indeed.&quot; And then she went on:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Japanese girls obey their parents.&quot; And
then she added, rather sadly, I thought, &quot;and
sometimes they are very unhappy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what then?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, deevorces&mdash;are very common among
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[pg&nbsp;47]</span>
the lower classes, but among the middle and
upper classes it is verry difficult.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So desuka!&quot; I said, for I was surprised.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So desu,&quot; said the Little Maid, which is
the proper answer.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">The Maid of Miyanoshita loves flowers, and
at sunset this afternoon I saw her coming down
from her garden, where she had been at work.
She had a great round straw hat on her black
hair. I got her to draw it about her face with
both hands, and with a camera she was caught
as she laughed. We went down the steps and
stopped above the cascade which shook the
water where the goldfishes were playing.</p>

<p class="indent">Now I have been a month in Japan; I have
seen the opening of the Diet, heard the Emperor
chant the fact that he was at peace with
all the world save Russia, and observed that
he must show origin from the gods in other
ways than in his stride. I have dined with the
gracious representative of the Stars and Stripes
and his staff, who seem to have taken on an
Oriental suavity that bodes well for our interests
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg&nbsp;48]</span>
in this Far East, and have seen an Imperial
Highness play the delicate and difficult
double rle of hand-shaking Democrat to
Americans and God-head to his own people&mdash;while
both looked on. I have eaten a Japanese
dinner at the Maple Club, while Geishas and
dancing-girls held fast the wondering Occidental
eye; have heard, there, American college
songs sung by Japanese statesmen, and have
joined hands with them in a swaying performance
of &quot;Auld Lang Syne.&quot; I have seen
wrestling matches that looked at first sight like
two fat ladies trying to push each other out
of a ring&mdash;but which was much more. I have
been to the theatre, to find the laugh checked
at my lips and to sit thereafter in silence, mystification,
and wonder. I have tossed pennies
to children&mdash;the &quot;babies&quot; who here &quot;are
kings&quot;&mdash;while wandering through blossoming
parks and among people whom I cannot yet
realize as real. I have visited shrines, temples;
have heard the wail of kite and the croak of
raven over the tombs of the Shoguns, and have
seen a Holy Father beating a drum and praying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[pg&nbsp;49]</span>
a day-long prayer with a cigarette-stub behind
one ear. I have learned that this is the
land of the seductive &quot;chit&quot; and the deceptive
yen which doubles your gold when you arrive
and makes you think that when you have spent
fifty cents you still have a dollar of it left.
Moreover, I have seen the glory of cherry-blossoms.
But of all these trifles and more&mdash;more,
perhaps, anon. I pulled a little red
guide-book out of my pocket.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That word,&quot; I asked, pointing to the
proper one, &quot;would you use that word to your&mdash;well,
your mother?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; she said very slowly, and with
straight eyes, again answering impersonal inquiry
with response even more impersonal,
&quot;I&mdash;don&#39;&mdash;don&#39;t&mdash;think&mdash;you&mdash;would&mdash;use&mdash;that
word&mdash;to your&mdash;mother.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The sunlight lay only on the great white
crest of Fuji. Everywhere else the swift dusk
of Japan was falling. In it the cherry-tree
was fast taking on the light of a great white
star. In the grove above us a nightingale sang.</p>

<p class="indent">Truly &#39;tis hard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[pg&nbsp;50]</span></p>


<hr class="hr2" />

<h2>III</h2>

<p class="h2">LINGERING IN TOKIO</p>

<p class="indent">I might as well confess, I suppose, that these
&quot;Hardships of the Campaign,&quot; pleasant as they
are, ecstatic as they might be to an untroubled
mind, constitute a bluff pure and simple.
Here goes another, but it shall be my last, and
I shall write no more until the needle of my
compass points to Manchuria. A month ago
the first column got away when the land was
lit with the glory of cherry-blossoms. We
have been leaving every week since&mdash;next week
we leave again. One man among us now calls
himself a cherry-blossom correspondent. He
was lucky to say it first. Clear across the
Pacific we can hear the chuckle at home over
our plight even from the dear ones who sent us
to Japan. If it were not such a tragedy it
would be very funny indeed.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">The stars float high in the sky of Japan, so
that when the moon rises, a vaster dome is lit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[pg&nbsp;51]</span>
up than I have ever seen anywhere else in the
world. The first moon I saw in Japan was
rising over the Bluff where the foreigners live
in Yokohama, and climbing slowly toward
those distant stars. The Happy Exile and I
had climbed a narrow, winding, bush-bordered
alley, broken here and there with short flights
of stone steps, and we sat on mats in his Japanese
home. Somewhere outside a nightingale
was singing and the fine needle-point of the
first cicada was jabbing vibrations into the
night air. To the left of the Happy Exile
was a beautiful box of lacquer, and he reached
out a caressing hand for it. That was his <i>netsuke</i>
box, and he pulled out little lacquer trays
in which lay his diminutive treasures.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have only about forty here,&quot; he said,
&quot;but they are all good. The dealers can&#39;t fool
me now, and if ever a new <i>netsuke</i> is brought
in from any part of Japan, the owner directly
or indirectly lets me know it is here. Sometimes
I will strike one in some far interior
town, but I know it has been sent on there
ahead of me, that I may think I have stumbled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[pg&nbsp;52]</span>
on a treasure. My big collection is at home&mdash;and
do you know that a man in Boston has
perhaps the best set in the world? They have
risen in value enormously, and are rising all
the time. There are not so many imitations
as people suppose, for the reason that the carvers
can&#39;t afford to spend the time that is necessary
to make even a good deception. You see, in
the old days each daimio had his carvers who
did nothing but make <i>netsukes</i>, and all time
was theirs.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then he began taking them out. Each one
represented a myth, a tradition, or a proverb.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I love these things not only for their exquisite
carving and their color and age, but
because they are so significant in reflecting Japanese
life and character. You have no idea
how much you can learn about Japan from
studying these curios.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Whiskey and soda were brought in. We
watched the moon, listened to the nightingale,
and the Happy Exile&#39;s talk drifted to old Japanese
poetry&mdash;to the little seventeen-syllable
form in which the Japanese has caught a picture,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>[pg&nbsp;53]</span>
a mood, one swift impression, or a sorrow.
Here are three that he gave me&mdash;but inaccurately
he said: &quot;A mother is sitting on a mat,
perhaps alone. The wind rattles the fragile
wall and she turns:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;The east wind blowing;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Oh, the little finger-holes</span><br />
<span class="i0">Through the shogis!&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Now, <i>shogis</i> are the little squares of latticed
paper that make the fragile wall, and mischievous
children delight in thrusting their fingers
through them. Those little finger-holes were
made by the vanished hand of a dead child.</p>

<p class="indent">This is a picture in three strokes:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Moonlight;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Across the mat</span><br />
<span class="i0">The shadow of a pine.</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Think of that for a while.</p>

<p class="indent">And here is another mother-cry for a dead
child. There are summer days in which every
Japanese child that can toddle is chasing
dragon-flies, and the children who die must pass
through a hundred worlds. So this mother&#39;s
thought runs thus:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg&nbsp;54]</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, little catcher of dragon-flies,</span><br />
<span class="i0">I wonder how far</span><br />
<span class="i0">You&#39;ve gone.</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">But I like best the first:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The east wind blowing;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Oh, the little finger-holes</span><br />
<span class="i0">Through the shogis!</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">We drifted out into the night air. Every
house was dark and quiet. The Happy Exile
stopped once to pat a yellow cur on the head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All these people know me,&quot; he said, &quot;and
I can step into any house without a word and
sleep the night.&quot; But we followed that narrow
alley up long flights of narrow, winding
steps, under thick bushes that arched above us
and shattered the moonbeams about our feet.
There was not a cloud in the sky when we
reached the top of the bluff, and I felt for the
first time what the magic of this land was to
the Happy Exile. The moon was soaring on
toward those stars&mdash;the stars that float high
in this sky of Japan.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Once I took refuge in a wrestling-match.
I found a great pagoda-like, circus-like tent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[pg&nbsp;55]</span>
made of bamboo with matting for a roof. Outside
long streamers of various colors floated
from the tops of long poles. High above and
on a little platform supported by four bamboos
a man was beating a drum. He had started
beating that drum at daybreak. About the entrance
and around the big, fragile structure was
the same crowd of men and boys that you
would find at an American circus. To get in
I paid two yen. Had my skin been yellow and
my eyes slant I would have dropped but one.
The arena inside was amphitheatrical in shape
with three broad tiers of benches on which
squatted the spectators. In the centre and
under a bamboo roof was a hummock of dirt
about two feet high. Four pillars swathed
with red and blue supported this roof, and from
each pillar was stretched a streamer from which
dangled little banners covered with Chinese
ideographs. A ring some twelve feet in diameter
was dug into the dirt hummock and in the
centre of this ring were two huge fat men, stark
naked except for a breech-clout. As I came
in, they rose and took hold. To the Saxon it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[pg&nbsp;56]</span>
looked at first glance like two fat ladies simply
trying to push each other out of the ring, and
I came near laughing aloud. Before I had approached
ten steps one of the two fat men
touched one foot outside of the ring. He had
lost and the bout was over. Now two more
came walking in with great dignity. They
mounted the arena and turned their backs upon
each other. Then each stretched out his right
leg with his right hand on the knee, raised it
high in the air and brought it down on the earth
with a mighty stamp. The same performance
with the left leg, and then they strained downward
until their buttocks almost touched the
earth. Turning, they squatted on their heels
opposite each other at the edge of the ring, and
each man slapped his hands together gently,
stretched them out at full length and turned
the palms over. This was a salute&mdash;the Japanese
equivalent of the Saxon pugilist&#39;s handshake.
Each walked then to one of the posts
from which hung a little box of salt, and his
second handed him there water in a <i>sake</i> cup.
He rinsed his mouth, spurted the water out, took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[pg&nbsp;57]</span>
a pinch of salt and threw it into the ring. One
of them stooped and plucked a few blades of
grass from the sod and threw them also into the
ring. Both these acts were meant to drive the
spirits of evil away, and it was all so serious that
I was aroused at once. Four times they squatted
like two huge game-cocks, and four times they
got up slowly, strolled leisurely to the salt-box
and the <i>sake</i> cup. At last they got together,
and there was a mighty tussle, and to my astonishment,
one of those giants threw the other
over his head and landed him some eight feet
outside the ring. Apparently there was more
in it than was evident to the casual eye, and it
was very serious business indeed. The fact is,
wrestling is an ancient and honorable calling
in Japan, and goes back to the sun goddess.
She had a brother once who used to annoy her
by killing wild animals and tossing them into
her backyard. One day she got angry and ran
away to a cave, leaving the earth in total darkness.
Her retainers, and the brother and his
retainers tried to get her out, but she refused
to come out&mdash;having blocked the cave with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[pg&nbsp;58]</span>
great stone. So they performed antics and
made strange cries until, tempted by curiosity,
she pushed the stone slightly away and looked
out, and thereupon one Taji Karac, stamping
the earth, rushed forward and tore the bowlder
away, and that is why the wrestlers stamp the
earth to-day. This is myth&mdash;what follows is
historical.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Once upon a time,&quot; said an American correspondent,
as he leaned over the bar that night
at the Imperial Hotel, &quot;a chesty noble got gay,
and remarked that he was about the best on
earth. The emperor heard of this, and sent a
challenge broadcast. A big chap took it up,
kicked in the chesty noble&#39;s ribs, and brake his
bones so that he died. This was twenty-four
years before celestial peace was proclaimed on
earth. About nine hundred years later, two
brothers claimed the throne and they agreed
to wrassle for it. They did it by proxy,
though, and one Korishito got the throne
through his champion. In the same century
there was a wrestling-match at the autumn festival
of the Five Grains. The harvest was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[pg&nbsp;59]</span>
good that year, and the emperor argued thereupon
that the coincident wrestling must be
good, and so wrestling became a permanent
national custom. When the champion Kiobashi
became referee the emperor gave him a
fan which proclaimed that he was the Prince
of Lions. The wrestlers were divided into east
and west, and that&#39;s why they come into the
arena from the east and west to-day. Hollyhock
is the flower of the east, the gourd-flower is
symbol of the west, and the path to the stage is
called the flower-path to-day. The pillars indicate
the points of the compass. The next champion
the emperor called the Driving Wind,
and the family of the Driving Wind alone
can hold the symbol of the referee to-day.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">These wrestlers are exempt from military
service, and they constitute, I understand, a
very close corporation. When an unusually
large child is born in Japan, the father and
mother say: &quot;He shall be a wrestler.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The wrestlers are enormous men, and average
over six feet in height. Some of them are
magnificent in shape, but as weight counts in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[pg&nbsp;60]</span>
science, they encourage fat. The present champion
weighs over three hundred pounds. Certainly,
as a class, the wrestlers show what Japan
can do in the way of producing big men. Constantly
I have been surprised not only at the
thick-set sturdiness, but at the average height
of the Japanese soldier as I see him in Tokio
on his way to the front. Moreover, I am told
that the height of Japanese school-children has
increased three inches within the last ten years
in the schools where the students sit in chairs
instead of squatting on the floor. And, among
the new types one sees in Tokio to-day, the dapper
men in European clothes about the clubs
and hotels, the statesmen in high hats and frock-suits,
the half-modernized class, who wear derby
hats and mackintoshes with fur collars and
show their legs naked to the knee when they
step from a rickshaw&mdash;the most interesting and
significant is the Tokio University student you
see lilting on his getas through the public gardens.
He has an intelligent face, looks you
straight in the eye, is agile as a panther, and as
tall, I believe, as the average college student.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>[pg&nbsp;61]</span>
I suppose the emperor issued an edict that his
people should grow taller and if he did&mdash;they
will. But these students&mdash;one can&#39;t help wondering
what, when they grow up, they will do
for Japan and to the rest of the East.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">With bird-like cries the rickshaw men turn
under an arched gateway into a little court-yard
paved with stones. The wheels rattle as in a
hollow vault and come to a sudden halt.
Straightway there is an answering bustle and
the shuffling of many little feet along the polished
floors to the entrance of the tea-house, and
many little brown maidens kneel there and
smile and gurgle a welcome. There the shoes
of the visitor come off, and if any man has forgotten
the first instruction Kipling gave, that
the visitor to Japan should take with him at
least one beautiful pair of socks, there is considerable
embarrassment for him. You are led
up a narrow stairway, each step of polished
wood, and into a big chamber covered with mats&mdash;the
wall toward the interior made of beautiful
screens, the other wall opening on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[pg&nbsp;62]</span>
outer air to a balcony. At the other end of the
room from the entrance a single beautiful vase
stands on a little platform, and in that vase is
one single beautiful flower. In front of that
vase is the seat of honor, and the guests are arranged
in front of it seated on thin cushions on
the floor. Straightway little nesan&mdash;serving-girls&mdash;carry
in little trays, a box filled with
ashes in which glow tiny bars of charcoal, a little
ash-receiver of bamboo, a bottle of <i>sake</i>, and
dainty little bowls without handles for drinking-cups.
Now one by one the brilliant little
stars of the drama appear. A geisha girl
glides in at the entrance, another and another,
and in a row sink to their knees and bow their
foreheads to the mat. Rising, they approach
ten steps and kneel again. Once more they approach
shuffling along the floor in their socks of
spotless white (the big toe in a separate pocket)
walking modestly pigeon-toed that the flaps of
their brilliant kimonos may part not at all, and
then they are bowing in front of the little trays
where they sit smiling and ready to serve you
with food and drink.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[pg&nbsp;63]</span>
There for the first time we saw Kamura&mdash;Kamura-san
you must say, if you would be
polite. She was pretty, and dainty, and graceful,
and her years were only fourteen, which by
our computation, would be thirteen only, since
the Japanese child is supposed to be a year old
when born. She spoke English very well, for
she had lived in Shanghai once where she had
played with American children. She was an
Eurasian&mdash;that is a half-caste&mdash;but that was a
secret which she told a few in confidence, for
you could not tell it from her face, and the fact
would be no little obstacle to the success of
her career as a geisha girl. Straightway little
Kamura-san was the favorite of the dinner party,
with the women as well as with the
men, and she acted as interpreter and said
many quaint, shrewd, unexpected things. The
women petted and caressed her, and the men
doubtless would have liked to do the same, but
that is not a Japanese custom. She turned to
one man of the party, and she spoke slowly and
with no shading of intonation whatever:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who was the very young gentleman with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[pg&nbsp;64]</span>
red cheeks who was here with you the other
night?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The man told her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He came back to see me alone. He wanted
to see me here alone, and he wanted the nesan
to leave the room, but I would not let the nesan
leave the room, and I did not understand.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">That innocence aroused considerable interest
in everybody and, later, the young gentleman&#39;s
cheeks got redder still, when the incident was
told him. Three days later I went to the tea-house
again. Kamura-san, baby that she was,
was to be sold soon to a Japanese.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">She already spoke such excellent English and
was so very intelligent that I wondered straightway
if it might not be feasible to buy little
Kamura-san myself and send her to school.
Her mother, I was told, wanted her to go to
school, and Kamura-san said that was what she
wanted to do&mdash;how sincerely I was soon to
learn. That mother had sold her several years
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[pg&nbsp;65]</span>
before to the master of the tea-house and to
get his money back the master of the tea-house
must sell her again. So the price of the child,
body and soul, was 750 yen or $375 in gold.
For $50 a year she could be sent to school in
Tokio, and I doubtless could find people to take
care of her, though Kamura-san said that she
would live with her mother and go to school,
which was better still. So I set about negotiations,
which were many and intricate. I had
to see her own mother, her house-mother, with
whom she and other geisha girls lived in Tokio,
and who made engagements for her and them
to dance at various tea-houses (she would be a
female manager of chorus-girls in this country),
and I would have to see the master of the tea-house.
I saw them all, and not one of them believed
that my purpose was what I said it was,
though all of them, except Kamura-san herself,
politely pretended to believe. As Kamura-san
had played with American children and knew
English well, I told her about America, and
strove to explain. She sat with her little face
downcast, her eyes dreamy and apparently taking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>[pg&nbsp;66]</span>
in every word I uttered. When I got
through she said simply:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yess, you will buy me out; you will give
me a house; I will be your Japanese wife
and wear European clothes.&quot; With her next
breath she would be saying how much she
wanted to go to school.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">The mother of Kamura-san lives in Yokohama.
Soon there was an amateur theatrical
performance there and I got the mistress of the
tea-house to let Kamura-san and a friend go
down to see it. In the afternoon I went to see
the mother, who was young, pretty, and very
lady-like. The little girl acted as interpreter,
and from her mother&#39;s lips told this story:</p>

<p class="indent">Kamura-san&#39;s father was an Austrian, and
therefore she was a half-caste. That, however,
was told me in confidence, and the fact I
must not repeat, since it would interfere with
her future. The mother had been his Japanese
wife, and she had loved him very much.
After a time the Austrian had been obliged to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[pg&nbsp;67]</span>
go home. He left the mother well provided
for&mdash;gave her a house and a good deal of
money. But she was, she said, young and foolish
and extravagant, made bad investments,
and lost it all. It was then that she sold
Kamura-san to the tea-house. She would be
very glad to have the little girl live with her
at home, and wanted her to go to school. Her
father, her mother said, would be humiliated
and chagrined if he knew that Kamura-san
was a geisha, and she wanted her daughter to
give the life up. Before the interview was over
I could see very plainly that the mother was
still expecting the daughter to follow in her
own footsteps.</p>

<p class="indent">The three went to the amateur theatrical
performance that night, and from another part
of the house I could see the little girl explaining
it to her friend and to her mother, and
the next night at the tea-house she rehearsed
several features of it to her fellow-geishas, and
her imitation of a barytone soloist, the way he
stood, lifted his shoulders, opened his mouth
and puffed out the volume of sound, was very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[pg&nbsp;68]</span>
funny, and made her companions squeak with
laughter.</p>

<p class="indent">Now, there was a young American officer who
was going around with me on these expeditions,
who was having considerable fun over my philanthropical
purpose, and was scornfully sceptical
of any success. He was on hand that
night and suddenly Kamura-san said:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My mother says I must not love young and
handsome gentleman.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because young and handsome gentleman
changes his heart.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I suppose I fill the bill.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yess,&quot; she said, &quot;you are a little handsome
and a little old.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you aren&#39;t going to love anybody, you
are going to school.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yess,&quot; said Kamura-san obediently.</p>

<p class="indent">Once more that night I tried to explain that
we did not rob cradles in America, and again
she looked dreamy and seemed to understand,
but when I started to go, she beckoned me behind
a screen:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[pg&nbsp;69]</span>
&quot;Did you bring the 750 yen?&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">It was the interpreter of the tea-house that
made me permanently hopeless. The interpreter
was soft-voiced, gentle, and spoke excellent
English. She had lived several years with an
American missionary&mdash;a woman whom she had
loved, she said, very tenderly. The interpreter
had been a widow for several years, and had a
little girl. She would never marry again, she
said, because she would have to give up her
child. So she spoke English in the tea-house
and taught the children of the master for a
pitiful salary. I cannot recall ever having met
such frankness in Japan, and this is what she
said:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you have 750 yen to spare, give it to the
poor families of Tokio whose sons have gone
to war. You buy Kamura-san from the tea-house
and you go away to Manchuria; you will
not know whether she goes to school. Most
likely her house-mother will sell her again.
Anyhow it is useless. She really does not want
to go to school. She likes the tea-house, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>[pg&nbsp;70]</span>
music, the lights and gossip, and the coming and
going of strangers. You cannot change her,
and it is no use. Give your money to poor
people in Tokio.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">After this Kamura-san&#39;s instincts told her
that something was wrong, and she began to
take perceptibly more notice of the young officer.
Once, as I was told, she said to him:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I always liked you best&mdash;you are so pretty.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">I charged her with this statement.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who told you that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never mind.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is a liar,&quot; said Kamura-san calmly.</p>

<p class="indent">And once I caught her making eyes at him
behind my back&mdash;something that she had never
done with me. With this, too, I charged her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; she said in denial, &quot;he is your
brother. He will be my best friend. He will
be godfather to our child.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">I staggered half-way across the room&mdash;that
infant talking of a child!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In heaven&#39;s good name,&quot; I said, &quot;what do
you want with a child?&quot;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>[pg&nbsp;71]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That I may not be lonely when I old,&quot;
said little Kamura-san.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Still, out of curiosity now, I went to see the
house-mother of Kamura-san. Her head was
poised on her shoulders like a snake&#39;s, and her
eyes were the eyes of a snake&mdash;black, beady, and
glittering. A face more hard, cunning, cruel,
and smilingly crafty I never saw, and it took
her but a little while to discover that I was an
unsatisfactory customer, and I couldn&#39;t help
wondering what that Austrian father would
have thought and felt had he seen that snake-like
hag trying to barter with me for his own
flesh and blood. I left the young officer there
and naturally the house-mother tried to sell the
child to him.</p>

<p class="indent">Kamura-san I never saw again. When I
came back from Manchuria I heard that she
was gone&mdash;whither I don&#39;t know, but I&#39;m hoping
that the Austrian father by some chance
may some day see these lines.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[pg&nbsp;72]</span>
But no more now of temples, blossoms, pictures,
<i>netsuke</i>, tea-houses, wrestling-matches,
theatres, and the what-not that everybody with
a pen has so wearisomely done to death. News
of the battle of Nanshan has come in. Next
week we leave again.</p>

<p class="indent">An explanation has occurred to me. You
know the Japanese does nearly everything but
his fighting&mdash;backward. Of course he reads
and writes backward. At the theatre you find
the dressing-room in the lobby. Keys turn
from left to right, boring-tools and screws, I
understand, turn from right to left, and a Japanese
carpenter draws his plane toward him
instead of pushing it away. Sometimes even
the Japanese thinks and talks backward. For
instance, suppose he says:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think I will go wash my hands.&quot; That,
in Japanese, is:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Te-wo aratte kimasho.&quot; Now, what he
really has said is literally:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hands having washed I think I will <i>come
back</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Perhaps then our trouble is that the Japanese
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>[pg&nbsp;73]</span>
tells the truth backward and we can&#39;t understand.
He might even be fighting that way&mdash;say,
for an alliance with Russia&mdash;and we still
should not understand&mdash;at least, not yet.</p>

<h2>IV</h2>

<p class="h2">MAKING FOR MANCHURIA</p>

<p class="indent">It came at last&mdash;that order for the front.
On the 18th day of July, the Empress of China
swung out of Yokohama Harbor, with eighteen
men on board, who had been waiting four
months for that order, almost to the very day.
During those four months there was hardly a
day that some one of those men was not led
to believe by the authorities in Tokio that in
the next ten days the order would come, and
never would the authorities say that during any
ten days the order would not come; so that
they had perforce to stay waiting in Tokio
from the freezing rains of March until the
sweltering days of midsummer.  Many of
those men had been in Japan for five months
and more, and yet knew absolutely nothing
of the land save of Tokio and Yokohama,
which, tourists tell me, are not Japan at all.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>[pg&nbsp;75]</span>
The matter has been passing strange. We
did not come over here at the invitation of the
Japanese Government, but in simple kindness
the authorities might have said, with justice:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This is the business of Japan and of Russia
alone. Over here we do not recognize the
Occidental God-given right of the newspapers
to divulge the private purposes of anybody.
We believe that War Correspondents are
harmful to the proper conduct of a war.
Frankly, we don&#39;t want you, and to the front
you can never go.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">No just complaint could have been made to
this. We should have seen beautiful Japan
and, our occupation gone for this war, at least,
we could have struck the backward trail of the
Saxon&mdash;the correspondent for some trade of
peace, the artist to &quot;drawing fruits and flowers
at home.&quot; And all would have been well.</p>

<p class="indent">Or:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You gentlemen came over here at your own
risk. You create a new and serious problem
for us and we don&#39;t know how we are going to
solve it. If you wish to stay on at your own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>[pg&nbsp;76]</span>
risk until we have made up our minds&mdash;you
are quite welcome.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For some this would have made an early
homeward flight easy. Or again:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, we do mean to let you go to the front,
but when we cannot say. While you are here,
however, we shall be glad to have you see our
country. Just now we are quite sure that you
will not go for at least ten days: so you can
travel around and come back. If we are sure
that you can&#39;t go for another ten days, you
may go away again and come back&mdash;and so on
until you do leave.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Even this they might have said:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You English are our allies. We are in
trouble, and we may draw you as allies into it.
We, therefore, grant your right to know how
we behave on the battle-field, where we may
possibly have to fight, shoulder to shoulder.
Therefore, you English correspondents, you
English attachs, can go to the front, the rest
of you cannot.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Nothing in all this could have given offence.
All or any of it would have had at least the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[pg&nbsp;77]</span>
combined merits of frankness, consideration,
honesty, and it is very hard for this Saxon to
understand how any or all could possibly have
any bearing on anybody&#39;s advantage or disadvantage,
as far as this war is concerned.</p>

<p class="indent">The Japanese gave no open hint of unwillingness
to have us go&mdash;no hint that we were
not to go very soon. We were urged to get
passes for ourselves, interpreters and servants
at once. Most of the men obeyed at once,
bought horses, outfits, provisions and wrote
farewell letters&mdash;wrote them many times. This
was the middle of March. Ever since we have
stayed at the Imperial Tomb in Tokio&mdash;the
Imperial Hotel is the name it calls itself&mdash;under
heavy expense to ourselves here and to the
dear ones at home who sent us here; unable
to go away; told every ten days that in the
next ten days we would most likely go, and
told on no day that within the next ten we
should not go. Now it was soon&mdash;&quot;very
soon&quot;&mdash;in English, and then it was &quot;tadaima&quot;&mdash;in
Japanese.</p>

<p class="indent">Tadaima! That, too, meant &quot;soon,&quot; when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>[pg&nbsp;78]</span>
I first put stumbling feet on the tortuous path
of Japanese thought and speech. The unwary
stranger will be told to-day that it does mean
&quot;soon,&quot; and as such in dictionaries he shall
find it. But I have tracked &quot;tadaima&quot; to its
lair and dragged it, naked and ashamed, into
the white light of truth. And I know &quot;tadaima&quot;
at any time refers only to the season
next to come. Early in March, for instance,
it means literally&mdash;&quot;next summer about two
o&#39;clock.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">All this was something of a strain in the
way of expectation, disappointment, worry,
wasted energy&mdash;idleness. And so with a worried
conscience over the expense to the above-mentioned
dear ones at home, and the hope
that some return might yet be made to them;
through a good deal of weakness and a good
deal of reluctance to go home and get &quot;guyed,&quot;
we stayed on and on. In May came the battle
of Nanshan and the advance on Port Arthur.
In June followed Tehlitzu. Both battles any
man would have gladly risked his life to see,
and I really think it would have been well for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>[pg&nbsp;79]</span>
the Japanese, granting their accounts of the
two battles as accurate&mdash;Russian atrocities in
one, undoubted Japanese gallantry in both&mdash;if
impartial observers had been there to confirm.
As it stands, the Japanese say &quot;you
did&quot;&mdash;the Russians say &quot;we didn&#39;t&quot;&mdash;and
there the matter will end.</p>

<p class="indent">But we swung out of Yokohama Harbor at
last&mdash;the Tokio slate for the time wiped clean
and all forgiven. We were going to the front
and that was balm to any wound. O-kin-san
of the Tea House of the Hundred Steps&mdash;bless
her!&mdash;had me turn my back while she struck
sparks with flint and steel behind me and made
prayers for my safety, and from her kind hand
I carried away a little ideographed block of
wood in a wicker case which would preserve
me from all bodily harm. Whither we were
bound we knew not for sure, since by the same
token you know nothing in this land for sure.
But there were three men among us who had
been guaranteed, they said, by the word of a
Major-General&#39;s mouth, that they should see
the fall of Port Arthur. So sure were they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[pg&nbsp;80]</span>
that they had made less important representatives
of their papers stay behind in Tokio to
await the going of the third column. Two
others had got the same assurance indirectly,
but from high authority, and the rest of us
knew that where they went, there went we.</p>

<p class="indent">That day and that night and next day we
had quiet seas and sunlight. The second night
we were dining in Kobbe at a hotel to which
Kipling once sang a just pan of praise&mdash;Kobbe,
which he knew at once, he said, was
Portland, Maine, though his feet had not then
touched American soil. He was quite right.
Kobbe might be any town anywhere. The
next daybreak was of shattered silver, and it
found us sailing through a still sea of silver
from which volcanic islands leaped everywhere
toward a silver sky. We were in the Inland
Sea. To the eye, it was an opal dream&mdash;that
Inland Sea&mdash;and the memory of it now is the
memory of a dream&mdash;a dream of magic waters,
silvery light and forlorn islands&mdash;bleak and
many-peaked above, and slashed with gloomy
ravines that race each other down to goblin-haunted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>[pg&nbsp;81]</span>
water-caves, where the voice of the
sea is never still. This sea narrowed by and
by into the Shimonoseki Straits, which turn
and twist through rocks, islands, and high green
hills. Through them we went into the open
ocean once more. In the middle of the next
afternoon we passed for a while through other
mountain-bordered straits, and by and by there
sat before the uplifted eye Nagasaki, with its
sleepy green terraces, rising from water-level
to low mountain-top&mdash;where the Madame
Chrysanthme of Loti&#39;s fiction is a living fact
to-day. Who was it that said, after reading
that book, he or she would like to read Pierre
Loti by Madame Chrysanthme? It must have
been a woman&mdash;and justly a woman&mdash;sure.
There is an English colony at Nagasaki and an
American or two who cling together and talk
about going home some day&mdash;all exiles, all
most hospitable to the stranger, and all unconsciously
touched with the pathos of the exile
wherever on earth you find him.</p>

<p class="indent">Between four and five o&#39;clock these exiles
take launches for a beach five miles away, since
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>[pg&nbsp;82]</span>
the Japanese regulations now forbid bathing at
any nearer point. They carry out cakes and tea
and other things to drink and I took one trip
with them through one beautifully radiant late
afternoon, but even in that way there was no
evading the Japanese. Two of them, whether
fishermen, sailors, officers, or what not, calmly
fixed their boat-hooks to the launch and there
they hung. The fact that the ladies of the
launch were undressing and dressing in one end
did not seem to disturb them at all, and to this
day I am wondering what possible harm a man
or a woman in a bathing-dress among waves
can do in time of war in a place that is impregnable
and five hundred miles from the
firing-line. I found the Japanese as different
in Nagasaki as is their speech. There they say
&quot;Nagasaki&quot; with a hard g. In Tokio, where
the classics are supreme, they pronounce it
&quot;Nangasaki,&quot; almost&mdash;just as the rickshaw
men in the one place lose something of the
samurai haughtiness that characterizes them in
the other. It is the difference between the flat
and the broad &quot;a&quot; in our own land, and between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>[pg&nbsp;83]</span>
the people who use the one and the people
who use the other. Everybody left next
morning, but I clung to Nagasaki as long as
I could, and in consequence took an all-night
ride on a wooden seat. Early next morning
I was crossing the Shimonoseki Straits from
Moji in a sampan. It was before sunrise. The
mist on the sea was still asleep, but on the
mountains it was starting its upward flight.
Through it fishing-boats were slipping like
ghosts, and here and there the dim shape of a
transport or a little torpedo-boat was visible.
The flush in the East was hardly as deep as a
pale rose before I was noiselessly oared to the
stone quay of the little village whence we were
to take transport at last for the front. The
foreign hotel was full. Richard Harding
Davis had gone to a Japanese hotel and had
left word for me to follow. So in a rickety
rickshaw I rattled after him through the empty
street. I found him in a Japanese room as
big as the dining-room of an American hotel,
covered with eighty mats, full of magic woodwork,
and looking out where there were no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[pg&nbsp;84]</span>
walls (the walls in a Japanese house are taken
out by day) for full fifty feet on mountain
and sea and passing transports and sampans.
Davis was unpacking. Hanging over the balcony
was a yellow moth of a girl some fourteen
years old, who smiled me welcome. On
another balcony at the other end of the hotel,
three other sister moths were lighted, and
among them I saw a correspondent beating
a typewriter vigorously&mdash;they watching him
with amazement and brushing him with their
wing-like sleeves as they hovered about.
Others still were fluttering fairy-like anywhere,
everywhere. The latest occupant of our room
had been the Marquis Ito&mdash;we found it quite
big enough for two of us. Li Hung Chang
had the same room when he came over to make
peace terms after the Japanese-Chinese War.
We could see the corner of the street near by
where a Japanese tried then to assassinate that
eminent Chinaman, and in that very room the
great Shimonoseki treaty was signed. We had
it two nights and a day, and we learned, when
we went away, that we were not told the history
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[pg&nbsp;85]</span>
of that room for nothing. First, our interpreters
hinted that great men like Ito and
Li Hung Chang and Our Honorable Selves
were always expected to make a present to the
hotel. It was the custom. We followed the
custom to the extent of ten yen each, and an
old lady came in and prostrated herself before
each of us in turn. Now, when you are clothed
only in pajamas, are seated in a chair, and have
your bare feet on a balcony in order to miss
no vagrant wind, it is somewhat embarrassing
to have a woman steal in without warning,
smite her forehead to the mat several times,
and make many signs and much speech of gratitude.
You won&#39;t smite yours in turn; you
can&#39;t bow as you sit, and if you rise, it looks
as though you were going to put foot on the
neck of a slave. We looked very red and felt
very foolish, but we did not exchange confidences.
If there was any slumbering supposition
in our minds that this was a polite Oriental
method of dealing with guests who have
doubtful luggage, or a slumbering hope that the
&quot;present&quot; might have a dwindling effect on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>[pg&nbsp;86]</span>
our bill, there needn&#39;t have been. We had to
pay in addition for that room and those eighty
mats and that Fuji landscape of delicate woodwork;
we had to pay for all the brilliant moths
that fluttered incessantly about, for the chamber-maids
and the smiling bronze scullery-girl
who looked in on us from the hallway; for the
bath-boy and the cook or cooks. Every junk
and sampan that passed had apparently sent a
toll for collection to that hotel. The gold of
the one sunset and the silver of the one dawn
were included in the turkey-tracked, serpent-long
bill that was unrolled before our wondering
eyes. In fact, if Marquis Ito&#39;s breakfast
and the biggest dinner that Li Hung Chang
had there nine years before were not put down
therein, it was a strange oversight on the part
of the all-seeing eye that had swept the horizon
of all creation during the itemization of that
bill. That was business&mdash;that bill. The present
had been custom. I cheerfully recommend
the method to highway robbers that captain
other palaces of extortion in other parts of the
world. Get the present first&mdash;it&#39;s a pretty custom&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[pg&nbsp;87]</span>
the rest is just as easy as it would
have been anyway.</p>

<p class="indent">Next day we went back again to Moji, where
a polite and dapper little officer examined us
and our passes and asked us many questions.
Why he did I know not, since he seemed to
know about us in advance, and every now and
then he would look up from a pass and say:
&quot;Oh, you are so-and-so&quot;&mdash;whereat &quot;so-and-so&quot;
would look a bit uneasy. At two o&#39;clock
that day we set sail&mdash;correspondents, interpreters,
servants, horses, a few soldiers, and much
ammunition&mdash;on the transport Heijo Maru.
Every ship has that &quot;Maru&quot; after its name,
and I have never been able to find out just
what it means&mdash;except that literally it is
&quot;round in shape.&quot; We steamed slowly past
a long, bleak, hump-backed little island that
had been the funeral pyre for the Japanese
dead in the war with China. For ordinarily
the Japanese, after taking a lock of hair, a
finger-nail, or the <i>inkobo</i> (a bone in the throat),
which they send back to relatives, burn their
dead. But this funeral pyre was for those who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>[pg&nbsp;88]</span>
died in the hospital, and the wounded and sick
therein could see by the flames at night where
next day their own ashes might lie. Thence
we turned northward toward the goal of five
months&#39; hope on the part of those hitherto unhappy
but now most cheerful eighteen men.</p>

<p class="indent">Fuji was on board. Fuji is my horse, and
he had come down by rail. He is Japanese
and a stallion&mdash;as most Japanese horses are.
He has a bushy, wayward mane, by the strands
of which you can box the compass with great
accuracy, and a bushy forelock that is just as
wayward. His head, physiognomy, and general
traits will come in better when later they get
an opportunity for display. All I knew then
of Fuji was that he had nearly pulled the arms
out of the sockets of several men, and had
broken one man&#39;s leg back in Tokio. I was
soon to learn that this was very little to know
about Fuji.</p>

<p class="indent">Takeuchi also was aboard. Takeuchi is my
interpreter and servant. He is tall and slender,
and has a narrow, intelligent face and general
proportions that an American girl characterized
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[pg&nbsp;89]</span>
as Greek. I call him the ever-faithful or
the ever-faithless&mdash;just as his mood for the day
happens to be. He keeps me guessing all the
time. When I make up my mind that I am
going to say harsh things next day, I find Takeuchi
tucking a blanket around me at three
o&#39;clock in the morning. He knows they are
coming, and when I do say them Takeuchi
answers, &quot;I beg you my pardon,&quot; in a way
that leads me to doubt which of us is the real
offender after all. Sometimes my watch and
money disappear, but Takeuchi turns up with
them the next morning, shaking his head and
with one wave of his hand toward the table.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not safe,&quot; he says, smiting his waistband,
where both were concealed. &quot;I keep him.&quot;
He has both now all the time. His first account
overran, to be sure, the exact amount
of his salary for one month and for that amount
I had him sign a receipt. Two hours later he
said, in perplexity:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do not understand the receipt I give
you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">I pointed out my willingness to be proven
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>[pg&nbsp;90]</span>
wrong. He worked for an hour on the account
and sighed:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are right,&quot; he said. &quot;I mistake. I
beg you my pardon.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He had overlooked among other things one
item&mdash;the funeral expenses of some relative,
which he had charged to me. I made it clear
that such an item was hardly legitimate and
since then we have had less trouble. However,
when he wishes anything, he says:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want you, etc., etc., etc.,&quot; and at the end
of the sentence he will say &quot;please,&quot; with great
humility; but until that &quot;please&quot; comes I am
not always sure which is servant and which is
master. From Takeuchi I have learned much
about Japanese character, especially about the
Buschido spirit&mdash;the fealty of Samurai to Daimio,
of retainer to Samurai, of servant to master.
It is useless to be harsh with or to scold
a Japanese servant. Just make your appeal
to that traditional spirit of loyalty and all will
be better&mdash;if not well. He may rob you himself
in the way of traditional commissions, but
you can be sure that he will allow the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>[pg&nbsp;91]</span>
privilege to nobody else. But of Takeuchi&mdash;as
of Fuji&mdash;more anon.</p>

<p class="indent">We sailed along at slow speed until we came
to the Elliott Group of Islands. We paid a
yen apiece for each meal, and the captain and
the purser&mdash;a nice little fellow who got autographs
from all who could write and pictures
from all who could draw&mdash;were the only officers
with whom we came in contact. We had
poker o&#39; nights, and sometimes o&#39; days, and
now and then we &quot;played the horses.&quot; Thus
we reached the Elliott Group of Islands.</p>

<p class="indent">There we had company, transports coming
in until there was a fleet of ten; other transports
going back to Japan, and an occasional
gun-boat hovering on the horizon. There we
stayed three wearing days&mdash;told each day that
we should start on the next at daybreak. But
there came one matchless sunset as a comfort&mdash;a
sunset that hung for a while over a low
jagged coast&mdash;a seething mass of flaming gold
and vivid, quivering green; that smote the sea
into sympathy, lent its colors to the mists that
rose therefrom, and sank slowly to one luminous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[pg&nbsp;92]</span>
band of yellow, above which one motionless
cloud of silver was, by some miracle, the
last to deepen into ashes and darkness. And
as it darkened in the West, some white clouds
in the East pushed tumbling crests of foam
over another range of hills, and above them the
full moon soared. Thus, all my life I had
waited to see at last, on a heathen coast, Turner
doing the sunset, while Whistler was arranging
colors in the place where the next dawn
was to come.</p>

<p class="indent">Here we saw Chinamen for the first time on
native heath. They came out to us in sampans,
always with one or two children in the
bow, to get scraps to eat at the port-holes aft,
or empty bottles, which they much prized; or
drifted past us on the swift tide, watching like
birds of prey for anything that might be thrown
overboard. And we saw the attitude of Japanese
toward Chinamen for the first time, as
well, and all the time one memory, incongruous
and unjust though it was, hung in my
mind&mdash;the memory of a town-bred mulatto in
a high hat with his thumbs in the arm-holes of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>[pg&nbsp;93]</span>
a white waistcoat, and loftily talking to a country
brother of deeper shade in the market-place
of a certain Southern town. One day a sampan,
with a very old man and a young one aboard,
made fast to the gangway. They had fish to
sell, and during the haggling that followed, a
Japanese sprang aboard, dropped a coin or two,
picked up the fish, and tried to cast the sampan
away&mdash;the Chinamen sputtering voluble but
feeble protests meanwhile. In the confusion,
the stern of the sampan struck a ship&#39;s boat that
was swinging on a long hawser from the same
gangway, the bow of it struck the ship&#39;s side,
and the racing tide did the rest. The boat was
overturned, old man and young one disappeared
and all under water shot away. We
thought they were gone, but there were two
lean, yellow arms fastened by yellow talons to
the keel, and in a moment the young man was
dragging the old man to safety on the bottom
of the boat. The ship&#39;s boat was cast away,
the Japanese who had caused the trouble
sprang aboard with the crew, gave chase to
the bobbing wreck, caught it several hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>[pg&nbsp;94]</span>
yards away, righted it, and later we saw the
young Chinaman working it, half submerged,
toward the distant shore, and the shivering, bedraggled
old one being brought back to the
ship. We were all indignant, for the officers
of the ship, far from interfering, laughed during
the whole affair, and, laughing, watched the
old man and the young one sweep away. But
no sooner was the old man aboard than the
servants and interpreters gave him rice, saki,
empty bottles, and clothes, and took up a subscription
for him; and when the young one got
to the ship an hour later the old man climbed
into the sampan, mellow and happy. It seemed
a heartless piece of cruelty at first, but it was
perhaps, after all, only the cruelty of children,
for which they were at once sorry and at once
tried to make amends. To me, its significance
was in the loftily superior, contemptuously patronizing
attitude of the Japanese toward the
yellow brother from whom he got civilization,
art, classical models, and a written speech.
Later, I found the same bearing raised to the
ninth degree in Manchuria. Knowing the grotesque
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>[pg&nbsp;95]</span>
results in the efforts of one imitative
race to adopt another civilization in my own
country, the parallelism has struck me forcibly
over here in dress, Occidental manners, the love
of interpreters for ponderous phraseology and
quotations, rigid insistence on form and red
tape and the letter thereof. Give a Japanese
a rule and he knows no exception on his part,
understands no variation therefrom on yours.
For instance, every afternoon we went into the
sea from that gangway, and Guy Scull diving
from the railing of the upper deck and Richard
Harding Davis diving for coins thrown from
the same deck into the water (and getting them,
too) created no little diversion for everybody
on board. On the third afternoon, Davis, in
his kimono and nothing else, was halted by the
first officer at the gangway. The captain had
found a transport rule to the effect that nobody
should be allowed to go in bathing&mdash;the
good reason being, of course, that some of several
hundred soldiers in bathing might drown.
Therefore, we eighteen men, though we were
in a way the guests of the captain&#39;s Government&mdash;in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>[pg&nbsp;96]</span>
spite of the fact that we were paying
for our own meals&mdash;and though for this reason
a distinction might have been made, the rule
was there, and, like Japanese soldiers, we had
to obey. It looked a trifle ominous.</p>

<p class="indent">We were only ten hours&#39; sail now from Port
Arthur, and one morning we did get away just
before sunrise. The start was mysterious, almost
majestic at that hour. For three days
those transports had lain around us&mdash;filled, I
was told, with soldiers, and yet not one soldier
had I seen. Blacker and more mysterious than
ever they looked in that dark hour before dawn&mdash;only
the first flush in the east showing sign
of something human in the column of black
smoke that was drifting from the funnel of
each. It showed, too, a gray mass lying low
on the water, and near a big black rock that
jutted from the sea. That gray mass gave
forth one unearthly shriek and that was all.
Instantly thereafterward it floated slowly
around that jutting rock; one by one the silent
black ships moved ghostlike after it, and when
the red sunburst came, that gave birth, I suppose,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>[pg&nbsp;97]</span>
to the flag of Japan, all in single file were
moving in a great circle out to sea&mdash;the prow
of each ship turning toward one red star that
looked down with impartial eyes where the
brown children of the sun were in a death-struggle
with the cubs of the Great White
Bear. By noon there was great cheer. The
Japanese word was good at last&mdash;we were
bound for Port Arthur. The rocky shore of
Manchuria was close at hand. A Japanese torpedo-boat
slipped by, its nose plunging through
every wave and playful as a dolphin, tossing
green water and white foam back over its whole
black length. A signal-station became visible
on one gray peak, and then there was a thrill
that took the soreness of five months from the
hearts of eighteen men. The sullen thunder of
a big gun moaned its way to us from Port Arthur.
There was not a man who had not long
dreamed of that grim easternmost symbol of
Russian aggression, and each man knew that
no matter what might happen on land, Port
Arthur held place and would hold place for
dramatic interest in the eyes of the world. Port
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>[pg&nbsp;98]</span>
Arthur we should see&mdash;stubborn siege and
fierce assaults&mdash;and gather stories by the handful
when it fell. Dalny was to our left, and
it was rather curious that we did not turn
toward Dalny. But no matter&mdash;we were going
into Talienwan Bay, which was only a few
miles farther away, and we could hear big
guns: so we were happy. Talienwan&mdash;a thin
curve of low gray stone buildings, hugging the
sweep of the bay, spread the welcome that the
officer of that port came to speak in English&mdash;and
we landed among carts, Chinese coolies,
Japanese soldiers, Chinese wagons, mules, donkeys,
horses, ponies, squealing stallions, ammunition,
a medley of human cries. The bustle
was terrific. A man must look out for himself
in that apparent confusion. As it was an
ever-faithful day for Takeuchi that day, I was
serene and trustful. Davis was not, and beckoned
to a coolie with a cart. The man came
and Davis&#39;s baggage was piled on the cart.
Along came a Japanese officer who, without a
word, threw the baggage to the ground&mdash;including
a camera and other things as fragile
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>[pg&nbsp;99]</span>
and hardly less precious. Davis turned to the
Post Officer:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can I have one of these carts?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">Davis got another, but while his interpreter
was loading his things again, the same officer
came by and tossed them again to the ground.
The interpreter protested and tried to explain
that he had permission to use the carts, but he
hadn&#39;t time. That officer turned on him. Now
I had been told that there are no oaths and vile
epithets in the Japanese tongue, but I know no
English vile enough to report what the man
said, and if I did I couldn&#39;t use it without
blistering my tongue and blackening my soul
more black than the hair of the blackguard who
used it. But let me do the Colonel in command
justice to say that when the outraged
interpreter, taken to him by us afterward, repeated
the insult, the courteous old gentleman
looked shocked and deeply hurt, and said he
would deal harshly with the man. I hope he
did.</p>

<p class="indent">This was ominous, but we were still cheerful.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[pg&nbsp;100]</span>
Yokoyama appeared and Yokoyama was ominous.
He was to handle our canteen and charge
us twice the prices that we had known at the
Imperial Hotel, on the ground that he would
transport our baggage for us. That meant that
he was to charge us for the transport service
that the Government was to give us&mdash;not to
him&mdash;and furnish us chiefly with canned stuff
that each man could have bought for himself
for a dollar per day. We did not know this
just then, but wily Yokoyama had gathered
in 500 yen from each of us in Tokio, and
he was ominous before we left Japan. I am
putting this in because Yokoyama, too, is
woven into the network that fate was casting
about us that day. Still we were cheerful.
Cannon were making the music we had waited
five months to hear. Port Arthur would fall,
doubtless, within ten days, and then&mdash;Home!
The dream was shattered before we went to
sleep. No officer came to tell us where we were
bound&mdash;to explain the shattered word of a
Major-General of his own army. It was Yokoyama
who dealt the blow&mdash;Yokoyama who, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg&nbsp;101]</span>
another land, would have been branded as a
traitor by his own people and could have been
put behind the bars in ours. The truth was
that we were not to go to Port Arthur at all.
Next day we travelled&mdash;whither God only
knew&mdash;with every boom of a big gun at the
Russian fortress behind us sounding the knell
of a hope in the heart of each and every man.
But we were on the trail of Oku&#39;s army into the
heart of Manchuria, though nobody knew it for
sure, and there was yet before us another tragedy&mdash;Liao-Yang.</p>

<h2>V</h2>

<p class="h2">ON THE WAR-DRAGON&#39;S TRAIL</p>

<p class="indent">There was the dean of the corps, one Melton
Prior, who, in spite of his years&mdash;may they
be many more&mdash;is still the first war artist in
the world. He was mounted on a white horse,
seventeen hands high and with a weak back
that has a history. Prior sold him in the end
to a canny Englishman, who sold him to
the Japanese&mdash;giving Prior the price asked.
&quot;Why, didn&#39;t you know that he wasn&#39;t
sound?&quot; said a man of another race, who
wondered, perhaps, that in a horse-trade blood
should so speak to blood even in a strange
land.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said the Englishman, &quot;but the Japanese
won&#39;t know it.&quot; They didn&#39;t. There
was Richard Harding Davis, who, for two reasons&mdash;the
power to pick from any given incident
the most details that will interest the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[pg&nbsp;103]</span>
people, and the good luck or good judgment to
be always just where the most interesting thing
is taking place (with one natural exception,
that shall be told)&mdash;is also supreme. Mounted
on another big horse was he&mdash;one Devery by
name&mdash;with a mule in the rear, of a name that
must equally appeal. Quite early, after purchase,
Davis had laid whispering lip to flapping
ear.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll call you Williams or I&#39;ll call you
Walker, just as you choose,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">There was no response.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then I&#39;ll call you both,&quot; said Davis, and
that wayward animal was Williams and Walker
through the campaign. A double name was
never more appropriate, for a flagrant double
life was his. There was Bill the Brill of the
gentle heart, on a nice chestnut; Burleigh, the
veteran, on a wretched beast that was equally
dangerous at either end; Lionel James with cart
and coolies of his own, and the Italian on a
handsome iron-gray. There were the two
Frenchmen&mdash;Reggie, the young, the gigantic,
the self-controlled and never complaining&mdash;so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>[pg&nbsp;104]</span>
beloved, that his very appearance always
brought the Marseillaise from us all&mdash;and
Lagueri, the courteous, ever-vivacious, irascible&mdash;so
typical that he might have stepped into
Manchuria from the stage. There was Whiting,
artist, on the littlest beast with the biggest
ambition that I ever saw vaulting on legs;
lanky Wallace, whose legs, like Lincoln&#39;s, were
long enough to reach the ground&mdash;even when
he was mounted&mdash;and there were the two
Smiths&mdash;English and American&mdash;and Lewis,
gifted with many tongues and a beautiful barytone,
who, his much-boasted milky steed being
lame, struck Oku&#39;s trail on foot. On Pit-a-Pat,
a pony that used to win and lose money
for us at the Yokohama races, was little
Clarkin the stubborn, the argumentative, who,
at a glance, was plainly sponsor for the highest
ideals of the paper that, in somebody&#39;s words,
made virtue a thing to be shunned; and, finally
and leastly, there were Fuji and his unhappy
attachment, who chronicles this.</p>

<p class="indent">These were the men who thought they were
going to Port Arthur and who, with the sound
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[pg&nbsp;105]</span>
of the big guns at that fortress growing fainter
behind them, struck Oku&#39;s trail, up through a
rolling valley that was bordered by two blue
volcanic mountain chains. The sky was cloudless
and the sun was hot. The roads were as
bad as roads would likely be after 4,000 years
of travel and 4,000 years of neglect, but the
wonder was that, after the Russian army had
tramped them twice and the Japanese army had
tramped them once, they were not worse.</p>

<p class="indent">The tail of the War-Dragon, whose jaws
were snapping at flying Russian heels far on
ahead, had been drawn on at dawn, and
through dust and mire and sand we followed
its squirming wake. On the top of every little
hill we could see it painfully crawling ahead&mdash;length
interminable, its vertebr carts, coolies,
Chinese wagons, its body columns of soldiers,
its scales the flashes of sword-scabbard
and wagon-tire&mdash;and whipping the dust heavenward
in clouds. The button on that tail
was Lynch the Irishman on a bicycle, and that
button was rolling itself headward&mdash;leading
us all. Behind, Lewis was eating the road up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[pg&nbsp;106]</span>
with a swinging English stride, and, drinking
the dust of the world, we followed. Fuji had
side-stepped from barrack-yard into that road,
sawing on his bit, pawing the earth, and squealing
challenges or boisterous love-calls to anything
and everything that walked. Sex, species,
biped, or quadruped&mdash;never knew I such
indiscriminate buoyancy&mdash;all were one to Fuji.
With malediction on tongue and murder in
heart, I sawed his gutta-percha mouth until
my fingers were blistered and my very jaws
ached, but I could hold him back only a while.
We overtook the Italian, a handsome boy with
a wild intensity of eye&mdash;one puttee unwound
and flying after him. The iron-gray was giving
trouble and he, too, was unhappy. We
passed Reggie&mdash;his great body stretched on a
lumpy heap of baggage&mdash;with a pipe in his
mouth, that was halved with his perennial
smile of unshakable good-humor, and the other
Frenchman squatting between two humps of
baggage on a jolting cart.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah!&quot; he cried with extended hands, &quot;you
see&mdash;you see&mdash;&quot; his head was tossed to one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>[pg&nbsp;107]</span>
side just then, he clutched wildly first one way
and then the other and with palms upward
again&mdash;&quot;you see how com<i>fort</i>able I am. It
ees gr-reat&mdash;gr-reat!&quot; From laughter I let
Fuji go then and he went&mdash;through coil after
coil of that war-dragon&#39;s length, past the creaking,
straining vertebr, taking a whack with
teeth or heels at something now and then and
something now and then taking a similar whack
at him. The etiquette of the road Fuji either
knew not, or cared nothing for&mdash;nor cared he
for distinctions of rank in his own world or
mine. By rights the led cavalry horses should
have had precedence. But nay, Fuji passed
two regiments without so much as &quot;by your
leave&quot;; but I was doing that for him vigorously
and, whenever he broke through the line,
I said two things, and I kept saying them that
I might not be cut off with a sword:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Warui desu!&quot; I said, which means &quot;He&#39;s
bad!&quot; and &quot;Gomen nasai,&quot; which is Japanese
for &quot;Beg pardon.&quot; These two phrases never
failed to bring a smile instead of the curse that
I might have got in any other army in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>[pg&nbsp;108]</span>
world. We passed even an officer who seemed
and was, no doubt, in a great and just hurry,
but even his eyes had to take the dust thrown
from Fuji&#39;s heels. I pulled the beast in at last
on top of a little hill whence I could see the battle-hills
of Nanshan. But I cared no more for
that field than did Fuji, both of us being too
much interested in life to care much for post-mortem
battle-fields, and when the rest came up,
we rode by Nanshan without turning up its
green slopes and on to where the first walled
Chinese city I had ever seen lifted its gate-towers
and high notched walls in glaring sunlight
and a mist of strangling dust. We passed
in through the city gates and stopped where
I know not. It was some bad-smelling spot
under a hot sun, and being off Fuji and in that
sun, I cared not. I have vague memories of
white men coming by and telling me to come
out of the sun and of not coming out of the sun;
of horses kicking and stamping near by and an
occasional neigh from Fuji hitched in the shade
of the city wall and guarded by a Chinaman; of
a yellow man asleep on a cart, his unguarded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>[pg&nbsp;109]</span>
face stark to that sun and a hundred flies crawling
about his open mouth; and of an altercation
going on between two white men. One
said:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your horse has kicked mine&mdash;remove
him!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Move your own,&quot; said another, and his
tone was that of some Lord Cyril in a melodrama.
&quot;Mine was there first.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The other took off his coat:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m sorry, but I&#39;ve got to fight you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well, then,&quot; said Lord Cyril, stripping,
too, and then the voice of a peace-maker
that I knew well broke in and in a moment all
was still. Takeuchi rode in on a mule. No
hitting the dust for the proud feet of Takeuchi
then, as I learned, nor afterward, when there
were any other four feet that could be made
to travel for hire.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want a &#39;betto,&#39;&quot; he said&mdash;which is Japanese
for hostler&mdash;&quot;for Fuji.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Whatever need there be for Fuji, the accursed,&quot;
said I, lapsing into such Oriental
phraseology as I had read in books, &quot;buy, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>[pg&nbsp;110]</span>
buy quickly&mdash;my money is in thy belt.&quot; He
bought then and kept on buying afterward.</p>

<p class="indent">Straightway I fell again into sun-dreams
with the yellow man near by whose mouth was
wide, for it was my first experience with the
God of Fire in his hell-hot Eastern home, and
I strayed in them until I was shaken into consciousness
by a white man with a beer-bottle
in his hand. I remember a garden and trees
next, a Chinese room with mats, a Chinese
woman&mdash;the first I had seen&mdash;with a sad,
pretty face, who rose, when I came to the door,
and stalked into a house as though she were
walking on deer-hoofs (every step she took on
her tiny, misshapen feet made me shudder),
and then the sound of Davis&#39;s guitar and
Lewis&#39;s voice on the soft night air and under
a Manchurian moon soaring starward above
the Eastern city-wall.</p>

<p class="indent">... It is noon of the second day now
and we sit in the shade of willow-trees. We
left that first Chinese town of Kinchau and
its dirty natives this morning at eight. The
dragon&#39;s tail again had been drawn ahead
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[pg&nbsp;111]</span>
through a narrow valley, rich in fields of millet
and corn, from which on either side a bleak,
hilly, treeless desert ran desolately to a blue
mountain chain. Now, still on its trail, we sit
in a green oasis, on real grass and under sheltering
willows. A lot of little Chinese boys
are around us, all naked except for a little embroidered
varicolored stomacher which hangs
by a cord from the neck of each&mdash;for what purpose
I know not&mdash;and their elders are bringing
water for us and sheaves of millet-blades for
the menagerie of beasts we ride. They seem
a good-natured race&mdash;these Manchurian farmers&mdash;genuine,
submissive, kindly, but genuine
and human in contrast, if I must say it, with
the Japanese. Who was it that said the Chinese
were the Saxons of the East and the Japanese
the Gauls? I know now what he meant.</p>

<p class="indent">Lewis, in a big white helmet, has just ridden
in on a diminutive white jackass. I envy the
peace and content of both of them, for Fuji
was particularly bad this morning. Again he
passed everything on the road, and as we swept
the length of a cavalry column, I saw a soldier
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>[pg&nbsp;112]</span>
leading a puny stallion a hundred yards ahead.
When he heard us, he shouted a warning:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Warui desu!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At the same time the beast he was leading
turned, with ears laid back and teeth showing,
and made for us, dragging the soldier
along. I was greatly pleased.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Here, Fuji,&quot; I said, &quot;is where my revenge
comes in. You are going to get it now and, if
I mistake not, literally in the neck.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But the brute attacked me instead&mdash;<i>me</i>. He
got my right forearm between his teeth and
held on until I shifted a stick from right hand
to left and beat him off&mdash;the soldier spouting
Japanese with French vivacity meanwhile and
tugging ineffectively. I got away only after
the vicious brute had pasted Fuji with both
heels first on one side of my right leg and then
similarly on the other, missing me about three
inches each time. Fuji now shows blood but
I am little hurt. Somehow in the scrimmage
O-kin-san&#39;s charm&mdash;the little block of wood&mdash;was
broken in its wicker case and whether the
heels reached it that high I don&#39;t know. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>[pg&nbsp;113]</span>
it was a good omen&mdash;that it should be broken
and its owner still come out unhurt&mdash;and it
means that I am to be safe in this campaign.
The puny brute had not strength enough to
break an Anglo-Saxon arm&mdash;and it is his kind
that make impossible for the Japanese certain
big guns that the Russians use.</p>

<p class="indent">T... It is 6 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> of the third day now
and we are at Wa-fang-tien. We left Pa-lien-tan
this morning and made thirty-two
miles. We took lunch in a stinking Chinese
village, and the chicken&mdash;well, it was a question
which was the more disturbing conjecture&mdash;how
long it had lived or how long it had
been dead. Oh, Yokoyama! Fuji has not improved.
He kicked the Italian on the leg today
and I&#39;ve just helped to bandage it. Again
to-day I had to let him go. I tried to tire him
out by riding him through mud-holes and see-sawing
him across deep wagon-ruts. But it
was no use. If a horse, bullock, man, woman,
child, cat, or dog is visible 500 yards away, Fuji
with a squeal makes for it. When the object
is overtaken, Fuji pays no attention to it, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[pg&nbsp;114]</span>
looks for something else toward which he can
start his squealing way. For brutal, insensate
curiosity give me Fuji, or rather give him to
anybody but me. &#39;Tis an Eveless land for
Fuji, but hope springs eternal for him. Dinner
is just over&mdash;tinned soup, half-cooked
tinned sausages, prunes and rice from Yokoyama&#39;s
larder&mdash;which we are stocking at 12
yen per day. Hundreds of coolies are squatting
along the railroad track. In front of us
a group of Japanese soldiers has stood for
five minutes staring at us with the frank curiosity
of children. They began to move away
when I pulled this note-book. Leaning against
the tallest telegraph-pole, with hands bound
behind him, his pigtail tied to a thick wire
twice twisted, stands a miserable Chinese coolie.
An hour ago I saw him on his knees across the
track, held down by four men, while the littlest
Japanese soldier in the group beat him heavily
with a stick much thicker than the thumb.
Then they led him praying, howling, and limping
to the telegraph-pole, where he stands as
an awful example to his fellows. He had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[pg&nbsp;115]</span>
stolen some coal and it was his second offence.
It was all right, of course, but it was strange
to see the apparent joy with which the Japanese
did it and stranger still to see the other
coolies grinning, chatting, and making fun of
the culprit. I wonder whether they were
crooking the pregnant hinges of the knee or
what on earth it did mean. We were hung up
here at 3 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, and allowed to go no farther.
There is no order for us to remain&mdash;only a
&quot;strong desire&quot; that we should&mdash;which is the
Japanese way. Davis and I had a great
bath to-day in a pool which somebody had
dammed up&mdash;for what purpose I know not.
What I do know is that it was not meant
for us.</p>

<p class="indent">... Sitting on the sand, we are this August
5th under birch saplings and by the side
of a running stream. Davis and Lewis are
asleep in the sand. Fifteen miles only is our
<i>mtier</i> to-day and Brill is anxious to go on.
The roads are bad farther on, say the Japanese,
and transportation difficult: the only satisfactory
reason yet given for this hideous delay,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>[pg&nbsp;116]</span>
and this, I&#39;m afraid, not the true one. They
simply don&#39;t trust us&mdash;that&#39;s all. The body
of the dragon is naturally getting bigger and
his vertebr are distinctly more lumpy. For instance,
he gathered in a train of thirty freight-cars
this morning and he had six hundred
coolies pulling it for him. The button of him
dropped back to-day toward the tip o&#39; tail that
is his anatomical place. Brill passed him on
the road. His bicycle-tire was punctured and
he was trying to mend it, Brill says, with 25-cent
postage-stamps. He evidently succeeded,
for he has just arrived. He seems to have had
a high old time on the way. At the last Chinese
village he halted long enough to offer a
prize&mdash;what I don&#39;t know&mdash;to the Chinese
child that could display the prettiest embroidered
stomacher. He had them lined up in a
shy, smiling row, and was about to deliver the
prize when the winner was suddenly thrust forward
with a wonderful piece on his chubby
tum-tum. The wild Irishman gave him the
prize, hoisted him on the bicycle and circled
the compound swiftly to the delight of the village.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>[pg&nbsp;117]</span>
I asked him how he communicated with
these isolated heathens and he said he talked
Irish to them. I&#39;m quite sure he does and he
seems to make himself understood.</p>

<p class="indent">It&#39;s sunset now at North Wa-fang-tien and
all of us are out in a hard-packed, sand-floor
yard under little birch trees. It was a hot ride
to-day&mdash;the last mile being over a glaring
white road and through glaring white sand.
That glare of a fierce sun made the head ache
and the very eyeballs burn. I almost reeled
from Fuji, who for that mile was, for the first
time, almost docile.</p>

<p class="indent">We had a shock and a thrill to-day&mdash;Brill,
Lewis, Davis, and I. It was noon, and while
we sat on a low stone wall in a grassy grove, a
few carts filled with wounded Japanese passed
slowly by. In one cart sat a man in a red
shirt, with a white handkerchief tied over his
head and under his chin. Facing him was a
bearded Japanese with a musket between his
knees. The man in the red shirt wearily turned
his face. It was young, smooth-shaven, and
<i>white</i>. The thrill was that the man was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>[pg&nbsp;118]</span>
first Russian prisoner we had seen&mdash;the shock
that among those yellow faces was a captive
with a skin like ours. I couldn&#39;t help feeling
pity and shame&mdash;pity for him and a shame for
myself that I needn&#39;t explain. I wondered how
I should have felt had I been in his place and
suddenly found four white men staring at me.
It&#39;s no use. Blood is thicker than water&mdash;or
anything else&mdash;in the end.</p>

<p class="indent">This is distinctly a human country&mdash;a country
of cornfields, beans and potatoes, horses,
cattle, sheep, dogs, goats, and no freaks in tree-trunk,
branch, or foliage. But I can&#39;t get over
seeing a Chinaman in a cornfield. It is always
a shock. He doesn&#39;t seem to have any right
there&mdash;somehow nobody does except a white
man or a darky. There are tumble-bugs in
the dusty road and gray, flying grasshopper-like
things that rise from the dust, flutter a few
feet from the earth and drop back again, just
as they do at home. And the dragon-flies&mdash;why,
they are nothing in the world but the
&quot;snake-doctors&quot; that I used to throw stones
at when I was a boy in the Bluegrass. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>[pg&nbsp;119]</span>
mountains are treeless and volcanic, but it&#39;s a
human country and I don&#39;t feel as far from
home as I did in Japan. Brill says it all looks
like a lot of Montana hills around Ohio cornfields:
only the corn is millet that grows twelve
feet high. The people eat the top, they feed
the blades to live-stock, and the stalk serves
almost every purpose of bamboo and for firewood
as well. You can ride for hours between
two solid walls of it, and you wonder how
there can be people enough in the scattering
villages to plant and till, or even to cut it. A
richer land I never saw. It looks as though it
would feed both armies, and yet there was no
sign&mdash;no burned house or robbed field or even
a cast-off bit of the soldier&#39;s equipment to show
that an army had ever passed that way. One
fact only spoke significantly of war. No woman&mdash;except
a child or a crone&mdash;was ever visible.
This struck me&mdash;when I recalled the trail
of the Massachusetts volunteers from Siboney
to Santiago and the thousands of women refugees
straggling into Caney&mdash;as very remarkable.
I suppose both Japanese and Russians
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>[pg&nbsp;120]</span>
are trying to keep the good-will of the Chinaman
as well as of the rest of the world. I
don&#39;t wonder that the Russians are fighting for
that land, nor shall I wonder should the Japanese,
if they win, try to keep it. But how it
should belong to anybody but the Chinaman
who has tilled it in peace and with no harm to
anybody for thousands of years&mdash;I can&#39;t for
the life of me see.</p>

<p class="indent">Next morning there was a sign of war. At
daybreak some red flecks from the dragon&#39;s
jaws drifted back from the mist and dust
through which he was writhing forward. It
looked, some man said, like the procession of
the damned who filed past Dante in hell.
Each man had a red roll around him. They
uttered no sound&mdash;they looked not at one another,
but stared vacantly and mildly at us as
they shuffled silently from the mist and shuffled
silently on. The expression of each was so like
the expression of the rest that they looked like
brothers. A more creepy, ghost-like thing I
never saw. I knew not what they were, but
they fascinated me and made me shudder, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>[pg&nbsp;121]</span>
I found myself drawing toward them, step by
step, hardly conscious that I was moving. I
do not recall that any one of us uttered a word.
Yet they were only sick men coming back from
the front&mdash;soldiers sick with the <i>kakke</i>, the
&quot;beriberi,&quot; the sleeping sickness. It was hard
to believe that the face of any one of them
had ever belonged to a soldier&mdash;-hard to believe
that sickness could make a soldier&#39;s face
so gentle. That man in the red shirt and those
gray ghosts that shuffled so silently out of one
mist and so silently into another are the high
lights in the two most vivid pictures I&#39;ve seen
thus far.</p>

<p class="indent">The beriberi comes from a diet of too much
fish and rice, I understand. It numbs the extremities
and has a paralyzing effect on body
and mind. Summer is its time and snow
checks its course. A man may have it a dozen
times and sometimes he dies. The young and
able-bodied are its favorite victims, old men
its rare ones, and women and foreigners it
wholly spares. It made great havoc among
Japanese soldiers in Korea, but the Japanese
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>[pg&nbsp;122]</span>
now conquer beriberi as though it were a Russian
metamorphosis.</p>

<p class="indent">Shung-yo-hing is the place now and the time
is 2 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> The heat was awful and the dust
from thousands of carts, coolies, and beasts
of burden choked the very lungs. I have the
bulge on Fuji now. I knot the reins and draw
them over the pommel of a McClellan saddle,
thus holding his muzzle close to his chest. It
seemed to puzzle Fuji a good deal.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He can&#39;t even neigh,&quot; I said to Brill in
triumph, and Brill cackled scorn. Fuji neighed
five times in the next ten yards. I should say
that his record in six hours to-day was about
this: stumbling with right forefoot&mdash;300
times; stumbling with left hind-foot&mdash;200
times; neighs&mdash;1,000.</p>

<p class="indent">There are about twenty miles more to Kaiping.
Haicheng has been taken by the Japanese.
Somebody has just come in with cheering
news&mdash;we can get back to Yokohama by water.
Gently we all said:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hooray!&quot; The parting from Fuji will
not be sad.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>[pg&nbsp;123]</span>
... This morning I found in one pocket
some strange pieces of paper with strange ideographs
thereon in Japanese.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What are these, Takeuchi?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Takeuchi looked really embarrassed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Prayers,&quot; he said. &quot;I got them at a temple.
If you carry them, you will get back
safe.&quot; Well, that made Takeuchi immune for
days.</p>

<p class="indent">At Kaiping we are now and we go to Haicheng
to-morrow. At least we think we do.
We got here last night: Fuji being lame, I left
him for Takeuchi to lead (he rode him, of
course); went on afoot and later climbed
aboard a freight-train drawn by 600 coolies.
I told the Japanese in my smattering best of
their language that my horse had gone lame,
and they were very polite. The train went
slowly along the dragon&#39;s length and I had a
chance to observe minutely those vertebr&mdash;heavy
Chinese wagons, the wheels with two
thick huge spokes cross-barred, the hoops of
wood and studded with big, shining rivets, and
the axles turning with the wheels; between the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>[pg&nbsp;124]</span>
shafts, a horse, bullock, or a mule; in front,
three leaders, usually donkeys, mules (the best
I&#39;ve seen out of America), or bullocks, in
all possible combinations of donkey, mule, or
bullock. Sometimes an ass colt trotted alongside.
The drivers were Chinese coolies, each
with a long whip&mdash;the butt of bamboo, the
shaft spliced with four cane reeds, the lash of
leather and the cracker as it is all over the
rural world. The two or three leaders of the
four- or five-in-hand, pulled by ropes attached
to the cart at either side of the cart to one side
of each shaft. The hames were two flat pieces
of wood, lashed to a straw collar that was
sometimes canvas-covered. The cries of the
drivers, strange as they sounded to the foreigner
near by, were at a distance strangely
like the cries of drivers everywhere:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Atta! Atta! Atta-atta-atta!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Usui! Usui!&mdash;u-u-u-su-u-i!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Whoa-a-ah!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At noon, Lionel James and little Clarkin
rode by and shouted that the Japanese Commandant
there had a lunch ready near by. We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>[pg&nbsp;125]</span>
found half a dozen tables set in the walled
yard of a Chinese farmhouse. All of us were
expected, but the others (except the Japanese
correspondents who were on hand) had gone
on. There was a nice sergeant there and a
grave major with medals, and there were soldiers
with fans to keep off the flies, while we
sat in an arbor, under white Malaga-like clusters
of grapes, and had tea and beer and tinned
Kobbe beef and army crackers. The rain started
when we started on&mdash;and when it rains in
Manchuria, it really seems to rain. I was on
foot in a light flannel shirt, and had no coat or
poncho. In ten minutes the road had a slippery
coating of mud, I was wet to the skin and,
as my boots had very low heels, I was slipping
right, left, and backward with every step.
Clarkin and James overtook me and we took
turns walking. In an hour the road was a very
swift river, belly-deep and with big waves&mdash;dangerous
to cross. Miles and miles we went
through muddy cornfields for four hours, until
we could see, across a yellow river, the high,
thick walls of Kaiping through the drizzling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>[pg&nbsp;126]</span>
mist. I waded the river, waist-high, and on
the other side an interpreter gave me a white
mule, which I took in order not to get my boots
muddy again. We wound into a city gate,
were stopped by a sentry and sent on again
around the city walls and three or four miles
across a muddy, slushy flat, full of deep wagon-ruts
and holes. After much floundering through
mud, and the fording of many streams, we
found the Commandant with his shoes under
his chair and his naked feet on the rungs.
James clicked his heels and saluted. We all
took off our hats, but as he neither rose nor
moved naked foot toward yawning shoe, we
put them back on again. We must go to Kaiping,
he said, and he was very indifferent and
smiled blandly when we told him that we had
just waded and swum from Kaiping. Just the
same we had to wade and swim back&mdash;by the
same floundering way and through gathering
darkness. We missed the way, of course, rode
entirely around the city walls, rode through
Kaiping and back again, and finally struck an
interpreter who piloted us to this Chinese temple
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>[pg&nbsp;127]</span>
where I write. I was cold, muddy, hungry,
and tired to the bone. But the button on the
dragon&#39;s tail was there, and Brill the gentle;
and, mother of mercies! they had things to eat
and to drink. An hour later, Davis came in
half-dead&mdash;leading Prior on Williams and
Walker. He had struck the same gentleman
of the naked foot and yawning shoe, had been
sent on, and had gone into a stream over his
head and crawled on hands and knees most of
the way through pitch dark. He didn&#39;t mind
himself, but Prior was elderly and was ill.
Davis wanted the Commandant to take him in,
but he refused and Davis was indignant:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wouldn&#39;t turn a water-snake out of doors
on a night like this.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But those two same Samaritans saved him
straightway, and we sit now in Chinese clothes
in front of a temple and under a great spreading,
full-leafed tree, with two horses champing
millet before the altar and thousands of buzzing
flies around. To-morrow we go on!</p>

<h2>VI</h2>

<p class="h2">THE WHITE SLAVES OF HAICHENG</p>

<p class="indent">Haicheng at last! The Russians are only
five miles away and they can drop shells on
us, but they don&#39;t. The attachs were taken
out on a reconnaissance yesterday, and we, too,
if we are very good, will be allowed to see a
Japanese soldier in a real ante-mortem trench.</p>

<p class="indent">We left Yoka-tong this morning at seven
and in three hours reached dirty, fly-ridden
Ta-shi-kao. The valley has broadened as we
have come north. The Chinese houses are better
and the millet-fields (kow-liang) stretch
away like a sea on each side of the road. Soldiers
were bathing in the river that we crossed
to get to the gate of Haicheng, and the stretch
of sand was dotted with naked men. Every
grove was, in color, mingled black, brown, and
dirty white from the carts, horses, and soldiers
packed under the trees. We found the courteous
Captain of Gendarmes, by accident, straightway,
and we had to take tea hot, tea cold, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>[pg&nbsp;129]</span>
tea with condensed milk before he would lead us
to our quarters in this mud compound. Lewis,
Reggie, and Scull greeted us with a shout and
produced beer and Tansan and a bottle of
champagne cider. Heavens, what nectar each
was! The rest are coming, but the button on
the dragon&#39;s tail&mdash;the Irishman on the bicycle&mdash;has
come off. Nobody knows where it
dropped. Reggie the big Frenchman is newly
mounted on a savage yellow beast that can be
approached, like a cow, only on the right side&mdash;and
Lewis told the story of the two. Davis
answered with the story of our tribulations&mdash;his,
Brill&#39;s and mine. He told it so well that
Brill and I wished we had been there....</p>

<p class="indent">We slept in our riding-clothes for the third
time last night and to-day we know our fate.
We are to play a week&#39;s engagement here in a
drama of still life&mdash;the title of which heads
these lines. With a sleeve-badge of identification
on&mdash;the Red Badge of Shame we call it&mdash;we
can wander more or less freely within the
city walls. We can even climb on them and
walk around the town&mdash;about two miles&mdash;but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>[pg&nbsp;130]</span>
we cannot go outside without a written application
from the entire company, and then only
under a guard. We are to have three guards,
by the way, and our letters&mdash;even private ones&mdash;are
to go to the censor and not come back to
us. Thus no man will know what has gone,
and what hasn&#39;t, or whether what went was
worth sending. Later this restriction was removed.</p>

<p class="indent">Our Three Guardsmen came to us last night
and told these things. One was thick-set,
bearded, and a son of Chicago University; one
was smooth-shaven, thin-faced&mdash;and an authority
on international law&mdash;both, of course,
speaking English. The third carried a small
mustache and talked very good French&mdash;so said
Reggie. After the usual apologies, the bearded
one said in partial excuse for shackling us:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Some of our common soldiers, never having
seen a foreigner before, are not able to
distinguish between you and Russians. We
wish to provide against accidents.&quot; And he
laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">An incident on the way here, yesterday afternoon,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>[pg&nbsp;131]</span>
made this sound plausible. I was riding
alone, and hearing a noise behind me I turned
in my saddle, to see a Japanese slipping upon
me with his bayonet half-drawn from his scabbard.
I stopped Fuji and said: &quot;Nan desuka?&quot;
(What is it?) and he, too, stopped, and
turned back. Whether this was a case in point
or whether he was drunk and showing off before
his companions, or whether my Tokio accent
paralyzed him, I don&#39;t know, but later,
the men who broke away from our guards and
got among the soldiers, testified that they received
nothing but courtesy, kindness, and
childlike curiosity from the Japanese Tommy
always.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You saw Nanshan?&quot; asked the bearded
one.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; I said. &quot;We want to see fighting,
not battle-fields.&quot; He laughed again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have had a very hard time, but I
think the fight at Liao-Yang will recompense
you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you heard anything from Port Arthur?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>[pg&nbsp;132]</span>
&quot;Nothing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We heard the guns as we came by and it
was very exasperating.&quot; He laughed again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We do not think much about Port Arthur.
That is only a question of time. Liao-Yang
will be decisive. The sooner the Russians give
up at Port Arthur, the better it will be for
them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But they not only lose their own ships,
but free the Japanese fleet for operations elsewhere.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s true.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And they free the investing army for operations
up here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s true.&quot; He shook his head. &quot;But
Liao-Yang will be decisive.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They got up to go then and the bearded one
simply bowed. The other two shook hands
all around, and when they were through, the
third said: &quot;Well, I will shake hands, too,&quot;
and he went the round.</p>

<p class="indent">Lewis has just come in&mdash;his face luminous
with joyful news. General Oku has sent us
over:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>[pg&nbsp;133]</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">1 doz. bottles of champagne.</span><br />
<span class="i0">4 doz. bottles of beer.</span><br />
<span class="i0">1 package of fly-paper.</span><br />
<span class="i0">1 live sheep.</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Liao-Yang is only about twenty-nine miles
away, and the Three Guardsmen say we are
not to be here very long. If the Russians can
drop a shell on us here, I wish they would&mdash;just
one, anyhow. Even one would save the
faces of us a little.</p>

<p class="indent">... That poor Manchuria lamb of General
Oku&#39;s died voluntarily this morning before
the canteen-man could kill it&mdash;but the champagne,
the beer, and the fly-paper are all the
heart could desire. This day has been interesting.
The Three Guardsmen rounded us up
this afternoon and took us to see General Oku.</p>

<p class="indent">We burnished up riding-gear and riding-clothes
and at three o&#39;clock the compound was
filled with squealing stallions and braying
jackasses. It took three men to saddle Reggie&#39;s
savage Mongolian. The Irishman, as usual,
was not to be found&mdash;he and Scull had gone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>[pg&nbsp;134]</span>
afoot, to the worry of the Three Guardsmen;
but we rode out finally, single-file, a brave but
strangely assorted company&mdash;Brill on his chestnut,
Lewis on a milk-white charger, the Italian
on an iron-gray, Davis on Devery, Lagueri on
a little white donkey, Prior on his seventeen-hand,
weak-backed white horse, and big Burleigh
on a tiny savage pony that pasted Prior&#39;s
horse, as we marched, with both heels.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why don&#39;t you go to the rear, Burleigh?&quot;
said Prior. &quot;That beast of yours kicks.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, he doesn&#39;t,&quot; said Burleigh indignantly.
&quot;He only bites.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">These two veterans and Davis wore ribbons
on the left breast. Dean Prior, indeed, seemed
to have his color-box there. I had a volunteer
policeman&#39;s badge that came from the mountains
of old Virginia. I was proud of it, and
it meant campaigns, too, but I couldn&#39;t pull
it amidst the glory of those three. Lieutenant
Satake, the authority on international law,
led. The bearded one guarded our centre and
the third watched our rear. At the city gate a
sergeant sprang to his feet:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>[pg&nbsp;135]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hoo&mdash;!&quot; he said, and I thought he was
going to give us a whole cheer, but it was only
a half. Still all the sentries sprang to attention
and the soldiers at the gate stood rigid as
their muskets. Over the stretch of white sand,
across the yellow river, and up a sandy road we
went, past staring sentries, and then into a little
Chinese village, where we dismounted. No
servants were allowed, so soldiers came forward
to hold our horses. Fuji was curvetting
no little.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Warui desu!&quot; I said, which still means,
&quot;He&#39;s bad,&quot; and the soldier smiled and led
Fuji far to one side.</p>

<p class="indent">We followed Satake into a court-yard. He
seemed rather nervous and presently motioned
us to halt. Presently he came back, called the
roll, and each man, after answering his name,
stepped to one side and stood in line where
there were two tables under grape arbors and
covered with cigars and cigarettes. Satake
looked relieved&mdash;not one of us had escaped;
even the Irishman was there. Several officers
stood expectantly about, and, after a long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>[pg&nbsp;136]</span>
pause, a tired-looking, slender man appeared,
accompanied by a rather stout, sleek-looking
young one, and followed by an officer with a
beard and a rather big nose that in color bespoke
considerable cheer. When they got near,
a sad-faced interpreter stepped forward and in
a sad, uneasy voice said:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have the honor to present you to His
Imperial Highness, Prince Nashimoto.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The sleek young man bowed and thrust out
his hand. We all advanced, spoke each his
own name, and shook. Prior said, &quot;Melton
Prior.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Burleigh, bending low, said, almost confidentially:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Burleigh.&quot; Davis came last&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Davis.&quot; Then the tired-looking man,
General Oku, and his aide with the nose of
good cheer, shook hands: only it was they who
went around the circle this time. The Prince
retired behind one of the tables and General
Oku stepped forward with his back to the
Prince, and through the sad interpreter said
things:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>[pg&nbsp;137]</span>
We had come thousands of miles and had
endured many hardships getting to the front,
and he welcomed us. He was sorry that on
the battle-field he could give us so few comforts,
but he was glad to see us and would do
all he could for us, etc., etc.</p>

<p class="indent">Such solemnity as there was! Aide stood
behind General&mdash;staff behind the aide. Most
of them kept their faces bent till chin touched
breast, and never looked up at all. If a high
priest had been making a prayer for the soul
of a dead monarch while other priests listened,
the scene could not have been more solemn.
Straight through, it was stiff, formal, uneasy&mdash;due,
of course, to the absence of a common
tongue and the uneasiness on the part of the
Japanese in receiving us after the Occidental
way; and I wondered if the scene would not
have been the same had Occidentals been receiving
the Japanese after the way of Japan.
But I think not&mdash;American humor and adaptability
would have lightened the gloom a little.
I watched Oku keenly. Though I had seen
him coming for twenty yards, I recalled suddenly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>[pg&nbsp;138]</span>
that I saw nothing but his face until he
got quite near. It was sad with something of
Lincoln&#39;s sadness. In profile, it was kindly,
especially when he smiled; full-faced there
were proofs that he could be iron and relentless.
But his eyes! Big, black, glittering,
fanatical, ever-moving they were, and you
caught them never but for a moment, but when
you did, they made you think of lightning and
thunder-storms. He was dressed simply in
olive-green serge, with one star on his cap and
three stars and three stripes on his sleeve. His
boots were good. His sword hung in his left
hand&mdash;unclinched. His other hand looked
nerveless. Not once did he shift his weight
from his right foot&mdash;only the sole of his left
ever touching the stone flagging. He is the
most remarkable looking man I&#39;ve seen thus far
among the Japanese, and I think we shall hear
from him.</p>

<p class="indent">Then the aide with the cheerful nose spoke
the same welcome and hoped we would obey
the regulations. Dean Prior answered, thanking
the General for the champagne, the beer,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>[pg&nbsp;139]</span>
the fly-paper, and the lamb, whose untoward
demise he gracefully skipped, and said he had
always been trusted by generals in the field and
hoped he would be trusted now. Then we
smoked and the Irishman spoke halting French
with the Prince, who (he looked it) had been
educated in Paris. General Oku asked questions
and we asked questions.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How long have you been in Japan?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;More than five months.&quot; He laughed and
his teeth were not good.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must know Tokio well.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know every stone in Tokio,&quot; somebody
said.</p>

<p class="indent">The General did not smile this time.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you been to Nikko?&quot; This was a
malicious chance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We were afraid to leave Tokio for fear
of not getting to the front.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shall we see much fighting?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think so&mdash;from a high place. You cannot
see in the valleys&mdash;the kow-liang is too
high to see over even on horseback. Yes, you
will see the fight.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>[pg&nbsp;140]</span>
Then we shook hands again, saluted the staff
and departed.</p>

<p class="indent">The Japanese soldier had Fuji behind a tree&mdash;and
he was smiling.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Warui desu!&quot; he said, and he looked at
me with approval that I dared ride him; for
Fuji was Japanese and bad, and Japanese are
not good horsemen. At any rate, he followed
me to the gate and held Fuji twice more before
we finally got away. On the way back
to captivity Lagueri turned a somersault over
his white donkey&#39;s head. He rose, spluttering,
between the donkey&#39;s forelegs. It looked for
a moment as though the donkey were riding
Lagueri.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">At sunset, next day, the Irishman said:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come with me,&quot; and I followed unquestioning,
because questioning was useless. Out
the compound we went, through narrow streets
and up a rocky little hill in the centre of the
village, where we could look over the low tiled
roofs&mdash;here and there a tree was growing up
through them&mdash;over the mud-enclosures, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>[pg&nbsp;141]</span>
high-notched city walls, the stretch of white
sand beyond, a broader stretch of green still
farther on, slit with the one flashing cimeter-like
sweep of the river&mdash;and then over the low
misty hills to the tender after-glow, above
which wisp-like, darkening clouds hung motionless.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Greatest people in the world,&quot; said the
Irishman with an all-encompassing sweep of
his right arm. &quot;All happy&mdash;all peaceful.
The soldier lowest here in the social scale&mdash;in
Japan, the highest. Home the unit. Tilled
the same soil for countless generations&mdash;always
plenty to eat. We forced opium on &#39;em with
war in &#39;52. To think they&#39;ve got to be cursed
with our blasted, blasting materialism.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">I had been through all that with the Irishman
many times before, so we went on. From
a gateway a cur barked viciously at us. An
old man came out to call him in and the Irishman
took the Chinaman by the arm and pointed
to a walled enclosure on the extreme summit.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want to get in there.&quot; How, on sight,
he wins the confidence of these people&mdash;men,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>[pg&nbsp;142]</span>
women, and children&mdash;how he makes himself
understood, not knowing a word of Chinese,
I don&#39;t know. Straightway the old fellow
went with us, the Irishman clinging to his arm,
pounded on the heavy door and left us.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A monastery,&quot; said the Irishman.</p>

<p class="indent">An ancient opened the portal, by and by,
and we went in&mdash;through an alley-way to a
court-yard, stone-flagged&mdash;and I almost gasped.
Temples age-worn, old gardens tangled and
unkempt and trees unpruned, dropped in terraces
below us; and with them in terraces
dropped, too, the notched gray walls that shut
in the hushed silence of the spot from the
noise of the outside world. Black-and-white
magpies flew noiselessly about among the trees.
Somewhere pigeons cooed and butterflies were
fluttering everywhere. It was a deserted Confucian
monastery&mdash;gone to wreck and ruin with
only one priest to guard it, but untouched by
the hand of Russian or Japanese. Both use
temples only when they must, and it seems that
Occidentals have much to learn from Tartar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>[pg&nbsp;143]</span>
and heathen in reverence for the things that
concern the universal soul. To escape that
compound, we should have pitched our tents
there, I suppose, had we been allowed. But
it was a place of peaceful refuge open to us
all. An Irishman had found it, and sharing
the discovery we sat there and dreamed in silence
until the after-glow was gone.</p>

<p class="indent">... It is pretty mournful this morning&mdash;rainy,
muddy, dreary, dark. We have established
a policing system&mdash;each man taking
turn; but the mud in the court-yard deepens
and the smells fade not at all. We have flies,
mosquitoes, night-bugs that are homelike in
species and scorpions that are not. Every man
shakes his shoes in the morning for a hiding
scorpion. A soldier brought in a dead one to-day,
that yesterday had bitten him on the hand.
He was bandaged to the shoulder, and but for
quick treatment might have lost his arm. It
can&#39;t be healthy in here, but only Dean Prior
and two others have been ill. What a game
Dean it is, by the way! He laughs at his sickness,
laughs when that big white horse with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>[pg&nbsp;144]</span>
weak back goes down in a river or mud-hole
with him, and never complains at all. I have
never seen such forbearance and patience and
good-humor among any set of men. If a man
wakes up cross and in an ill-humor&mdash;that day
is his. He may kick somebody&#39;s water-pail
over the wall, storm at his servant, curse out
the food, and be a general irritable nuisance;
but the rest forbear, look down at their plates,
and nobody says a word, for each knows that
the next day may be his. This forbearance is
one benefit anyhow that we are getting out of
this campaign, which is a sad, sad waste thus
far. But Reggie appears at the door. As he
marches past us we rise and sing the Marseillaise;
when he marches back, we sing it again,
and that smile of his is reward enough. There
is good news&mdash;<i>we</i> are to go out on a reconnaissance
to-morrow, ourselves.</p>

<p class="indent">Holy Moses! but that reconnaissance was a
terrifying experience. We went out past the
station where the last fight was, along a dusty
road and up a little hill, left our horses under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>[pg&nbsp;145]</span>
its protecting bulk, sneaked over the top, and
boldly stood upright on the slant of the other
side. Below us was a big rude cross over a
Russian grave. Things were pointed out to us.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You see that big camel-backed mountain
there,&quot; said one of the Three Guardsmen. We
levelled glasses. &quot;Well, that&#39;s where the main
body of the Russians are.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How far away is that camel-back?&quot; somebody
asked innocently. The Guardsman had
turned and was beckoning violently to the Italian
(who was on top of the little hill, some
thirty feet above us) to come down. Then
he said:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;About ten miles.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So desuka!&quot; (truly) said the same voice,
lapsing with awe into Japanese.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So desu!&quot;&mdash;which is &quot;truly&quot; in response,&mdash;said
the Guardsman with satisfaction, and
we had a thrill. The Italian now had blithely
drawn near. He seemed unafraid, but perhaps
he had been unaware of his peril on the skyline
only ten miles from a Russian gun.</p>

<p class="indent">Then we cautiously advanced along the road
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>[pg&nbsp;146]</span>
for another half a mile to an empty trench in
a little camp near which there must have been
all of twenty Japanese soldiers. One correspondent
stepped across the trench and was
gesticulated back with some warmth. Davis
sat down on the trench and was politely asked
to get up and move back&mdash;not that he would
hurt the trench, but because he was sitting on
the half of it that was next the ten-mile-away
enemy&mdash;and apparently the Guardsman had
orders that we must not cross a carefully
marked line. Davis got up like a shot and
hurriedly went away back to sit down.</p>

<p class="indent">The major of the post there gave us tea and
beer at his quarters near by. He was a big fellow
and was most kind and courteous. He
had been a professor in a war-college and had
asked the privilege of death at the front. He
got it, poor fellow, and later I saw a picture
of his body being burned after the fight at
Liao-Yang.</p>

<p class="indent">We are getting pretty restless now. The
Irishman and I were denied admittance at the
monastery yesterday by the order of the Imperial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>[pg&nbsp;147]</span>
Highness whom we met the other day.
However, he relaxed it in our favor. Dean
Prior started to go up on the city wall to-day
to sketch, and was stopped by a sentry, who put
a naked bayonet within two feet of his breast.
He came back raging, and wrote a scathing
letter which I don&#39;t think he will send.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">This morning <i>Wong</i> came.</p>

<p class="indent">At ten o&#39;clock the Irishman appeared at the
entrance of the compound, leading by the hand
a little Chinese boy some eight or ten years old.
He was the dirtiest little wretch I ever saw, but
he smiled&mdash;and never saw I such teeth or such
a winsome smile. The Irishman said simply
and gravely:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This is Wong,&quot; and no more. He led the
boy behind the paling that enclosed our bathing-quarters,
plucking, as he walked, a sponge
and a cake of soap, which happened to be mine.
Then I heard:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Take it off!&quot; And again: &quot;Take it off,
I say!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Apparently he was obeyed. Then:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>[pg&nbsp;148]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Take that off, too; yes, that, too!&quot; Evidently
the boy had but two garments on, for
considerable splashing took the place of peremptory
commands. By and by they came out
together and, still hand in hand, passed out of
the compound. In half an hour the Irishman
came back.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ve just taken Wong down to Poole&#39;s,&quot;
he said, still gravely, &quot;to get him a new suit
of clothes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The trousers were too long, and Wong objected.
Poole told him that trousers were worn
long this season, and Wong compromised by
rolling them up. He&#39;ll be here by and by.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">By and by Wong came back resplendent in
new blouse, new trousers, new shoes and socks.
On his breast was sewed a big white piece of
cotton in the shape of a shamrock, and on the
shamrock was printed this:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">WONG</span><br />
<span class="i0"><i>Cup-bearer and Page in Waiting</i></span><br />
<span class="i4">to</span><br />
<span class="i2">&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;, <i>Esquire</i>.</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>[pg&nbsp;149]</span>
Straightway was Wong an habitu of the
compound and straightway his education began.
Wong was quick to learn.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Attention, Wong!&quot; the Irishman would
say, and Wong would spring to his feet and
dash for a bottle of&mdash;Tansan.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Make ready!&quot; Wong would poise the
bottle. &quot;Aim&mdash;fire!&quot; Wong would fire, and
then would come the command, &quot;When!&quot;
which meant &quot;cease firing!&quot; and Wong, perfect
little soldier that he was, would cease,
though his genial hospitality and genuine concern
for the happiness of everybody made ceasing
very hard. If his master ordered a bottle
of wine at the table, Wong would pass it to
every man. He was equally hospitable in the
matter of cigarettes&mdash;anybody&#39;s; for he could
never see that what belonged to one man did
not belong to all. Essentially, in that crowd,
he was right. But it was rather expensive for
the Irishman, until one day he told Wong always
to take the chits to &quot;that fat man&quot;&mdash;who
was not Reggie&mdash;and thereafter the fat
man got them.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>[pg&nbsp;150]</span>
Wong had caught the military salute from
the Japanese soldiers, and every morning, when
he came in, he would go around to each of us
in turn, clicking his heels, hand at his forehead,
and always with that radiant smile flashing
from his gentle eyes and his beautiful teeth.
The Irishman always slept late. One morning
he was awakened by an insistent little voice outside
his mosquito-net, saying, over and over:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hello, George; wake up! Hello, George;
wake up!&quot; Somebody had taught him that;
but he saw straightway that it was not respectful,
and we could never get him to do
it again.</p>

<p class="indent">After his second bath he went around pulling
his shirt open to show how clean his yellow
little body was. Indeed, he got such a passion
for cleanliness that one morning he nively held
out his exquisite hands to Lewis to be manicured&mdash;Lewis
did it. Again, when Tansan
spouted into his face, he reached out, pulled
a silk handkerchief from a man&#39;s pocket and
mopped his face. All of us got to love that
boy, and when we went away there was a consultation.
We would make up a fund and educate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>[pg&nbsp;151]</span>
him. His father was called in and an interpreter
explained our design. Wong burst
into tears and wept bitterly. There were answering
drops in the Irishman&#39;s eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I tell you, all the blood shed in this miserable
war is not worth those few precious
tears. Greatest people on earth! Why should
he want to leave them?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Lovable little Wong! The first word the
Irishman said when he came back through that
town on our way home was spoken to a group
of boys on the street.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wong!&quot; he said simply, and they raised
a shout of comprehension and dashed away,
the Irishman after them. Half an hour later
he joined me in a restaurant. Wong was not
in town, he said gravely; he had bought a place
outside of town with the money we had given
him, and had taken his family into the country
for the hot season. Anyhow, we saw Wong
the gentle, Wong the winning, no more.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">A major came this morning to give us a lecture
on the battle of Tehlitzu&mdash;to while away
the tedium, said one of the Guardsmen. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>[pg&nbsp;152]</span>
Major is smooth-shaven and very broad between
the cheek-bones. His hair is clipped
short, his eyes are large, and his face is strong.
He must have been a professor in a war-college,
for he stood up and drew mountains, hills, valleys,
positions, trenches, trees, and made figures&mdash;all
with wonderful rapidity and skill&mdash;backward.
That is, he made them for us standing
in front of him to look at. A certain division,
he said, of a certain regiment, at a certain time
had done a certain thing. It was a perfect
lecture except that all the really essential facts
were skilfully suppressed.</p>

<p class="indent">The Major had been present only as an observer&mdash;a
student&mdash;but at one hot place on
which he put his finger, he had &quot;lost many
friends there,&quot; he said impassively.</p>

<p class="indent">At that place a young Russian officer led a
charge, and his men refused to follow him.
The officer drew a dagger and smilingly killed
himself.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We all speak much of that man,&quot; said the
Major.</p>

<p class="indent">At another place the ammunition gave out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>[pg&nbsp;153]</span>
on both sides, and Japanese and Russians
fought with stones&mdash;men on both sides being
severely wounded. While this was going on
some Russian officers advanced, sword in hand,
from another point, but they had no followers.
One of them started forward and gave challenge.
A Japanese officer sprang to meet him,
and a duel was fought while soldiers of both
armies looked on. &quot;The Japanese was fortunate
enough to despatch the Russian,&quot; said the
Major modestly and dispassionately, &quot;and we
buried him with much ceremony and put a barrier
over him. It was an interesting study&mdash;this
battle&mdash;as to whether it is better to fight a
defensive or an offensive enemy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I&#39;d rather have seen that rock-fight,&quot;
said a correspondent, &quot;and that duel
than the whole battle.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Major looked puzzled and shocked, and
went on to tell how they had captured a fat
Russian colonel&mdash;whose horse was wounded
and whose coat was gone.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He said our artillery fire was&mdash;&quot; the Major
paused, used a Russian word, and turned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>[pg&nbsp;154]</span>
to the interpreter helplessly&mdash;and the interpreter
said:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ungodly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said the Major, and he smiled.
&quot;The first thing the Russian asked for was a
bottle of soda-water, which made us laugh.
We do not carry such things in the fields. I
gave him ten cigarettes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How many men did the Japanese have in
that fight?&quot; asked a correspondent.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Just as many as they have now,&quot; was the
illuminating answer.</p>

<p class="indent">I wonder if anybody but the Japanese knows
how many men they have really had in any
fight, and whether in consequence their victories
have been due to astonishing skill or overwhelming
numbers. There is rumor of one lost
Japanese division, the whereabouts of which
nobody&mdash;but the Japanese&mdash;knows. It could
have been in every fight thus far and nobody&mdash;but
the Japanese&mdash;could know.</p>

<p class="indent">We are getting mighty tired now. Several
of us concluded up at the monastery to-day
that we would go home pretty soon unless there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>[pg&nbsp;155]</span>
was a change. There we took pictures of temples,
monoliths, stone-turtles. The Irishman
appeared suddenly&mdash;coming down the long
steps above us, leading a Chinese child by the
hand and carrying a younger one in his arms.
How or where he gathers in children the way
he does, is a mystery to all of us. Then we
took more pictures and four officers came in.
We communicated in a Babel of French, German,
English, Chinese, and Japanese. They
got tea for us from the priest, and were very
polite. Later two more came in. Davis and
I were writing, and they stood around and
looked at us for a while. One approached.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What are you doing there?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Writing,&quot; I said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Drawing?&quot; he asked suspiciously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, drawing,&quot; said Davis. &quot;Why do
you want to know what we are doing?&quot; I
don&#39;t think the officer understood&mdash;but he understood
that something was wrong, and he
stood a moment in some awkwardness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good-a-by!&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sayonara,&quot; we answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>[pg&nbsp;156]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t think it is anything but curiosity,&quot;
I said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A good deal of it is&mdash;because they don&#39;t
know that they oughtn&#39;t to show it. He put
us at once in the attitude of being spies. I
can&#39;t imagine what he thought we were drawing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We didn&#39;t have our badges on. He might
have arrested us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That would have been some diversion.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The day has been warm, brilliant&mdash;the sky
crystalline, deep, and flecked with streamers of
wool. At sunset now the rain is sweeping the
west like a giant broom, the rush of wind and
river is indistinguishable, the silent magpies are
flying about, but there is still a mighty peace
within these walls. Back now to mud, flies,
and fleas.</p>

<p class="indent">It&#39;s 1 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> The fleas won&#39;t sleep, and for
that reason I can&#39;t. Even the drone of school-children
chanting Chinese classics&mdash;as our little
mountaineers chant the alphabet in a &quot;blab-school&quot;&mdash;and
the barking of dogs have ceased.
Somewhere out in the darkness picket-fires are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>[pg&nbsp;157]</span>
shining where the Sun-children and the White
Cubs are soon to lock in a fierce embrace. I
like this Manchurian land and I like the Chinaman.
Both are human and the country is
homelike&mdash;with its cornfields, horses, mules,
cattle, and sheep and dogs. The striking difference
is here, you see no women except very
old ones or little girls. Here is the absence
of that insistent plague&mdash;human manure&mdash;that
disgusts the sensitive nose in Japan.
The &quot;fragrant summer-time&quot; would have been
a satire if it had been written in Japan.
But there is no charm here as there is everywhere
in Nature and Man in Japan. Besides
the Chinese, here at least, are filthy in
person and in their homes&mdash;the smell of the
Chinaman is positively acrid&mdash;while the Japanese
are beyond doubt the very cleanliest people
in the world. I wish I could see for myself
what they really are in battle. As far as I can
make out at long distance, the Japanese army
and the individual Japanese soldier seem the
best in the world: the soldier for the reason
that he cares no more for death than the average
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>[pg&nbsp;158]</span>
Occidental for an afternoon nap&mdash;the army
for the reason that the Buschido spirit&mdash;feudal
fealty&mdash;having been transferred from Daimio
and Samurai to Colonel and General&mdash;gives it
a discipline that seems perfect. Imagine an
army without stragglers or camp-followers, in
which one man is as good as another and all
boast of but one thing&mdash;a willingness to die.
It looks as though for the first time in history
the fanatical spirit of the Mussulman who believed
that he would step, at death, from the
battle-field into Paradise, was directed by an
acute and world-trained intelligence. As to
the soldier, the pivotal point of effectiveness
seems to be this: an Occidental and a Japanese
quarrel, and they step outside to settle matters.
The Occidental thinks not only of killing the
Japanese, but of getting out alive. His energies
are divided, his concentration of purpose
suffers. The Japanese has no such division&mdash;he
is concerned only with killing his opponent,
and he doesn&#39;t seem to care whether or not he
comes out alive or dead. I&#39;m wondering,
though, whether he would fight this way for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>[pg&nbsp;159]</span>
England&mdash;whether he will ever fight again this
way for himself.</p>

<p class="indent">It has been cold the last two days. The flies
have almost disappeared and the fleas are less
active&mdash;in numbers, anyhow. Two officers
came to see us last night and it&#39;s the first time
we have been honored in this way. One had
a long sword 400 years old&mdash;the other a short
one 500 years old, and both were wonderful
blades. Now, the sword of a Samurai was his
soul, and the man who even stepped over it
did it at the peril of his life. I was rather surprised
that they let us handle them so freely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We are to leave here very soon,&quot; they said.</p>

<p class="indent">To-morrow we do leave&mdash;toward Liao-Yang.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>[pg&nbsp;160]</span></p>

<h2>VII</h2>

<p class="h2">THE BACKWARD TRAIL OF THE
SAXON</p>


<p class="indent">Out at the gate of the compound, last night,
a barytone voice lifted a pan of praise to the
very stars. We were to leave that wretched
enclosure next day, the Three Guardsmen said,
and that night the White Slaves listened to
the barking of dogs, the droning chorus of
school-children chanting Chinese classics and
the medley of small noises in streets and compound,
and sank to sleep for the last time in
Haicheng. As usual, the raucous cries of Dean
Prior and Burleigh ushered in the dawn, and
the usual awakening and bustle of servants and
masters followed. For the last time Little
Wong, Cup-bearer and Page-in-Waiting, with
his hand at his forehead, clicked his heels before
each of us in turn, stirred his master, the
Irishman, from slumber deep, and, with a radiant
smile and flashing teeth, fired volleys of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>[pg&nbsp;161]</span>
Tansan right and left. Within half an hour
we were gathered under Yokoyama&#39;s tent for
our last breakfast. For the last time Big Reggie,
the Frenchman, marched past us, and for
the last time we made him keep step to a ringing
Marseillaise. Half an hour later, the compound
was full of squealing horses, and soon
carts, coolies, the White Slaves of Haicheng,
and the Three Guardsmen wound out of the
gate, through the narrow streets and under the
city wall&mdash;on the way to see a battle at last.
Two hours we marched, climbed then a little
hill, left our horses on the hither side, crawled
over the top to where that battle was raging&mdash;some
ten miles away. Up in the mountains
somebody was evidently letting loose giant
puffs of cigarette-smoke high in the air. No
sound was perceptible, but they were shells, a
Guardsman said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Whose shells?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; said the Guardsman. As
a matter of fact, those shells were so far away
that we could not tell whether they were Russian
or Japanese, whether they were coming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>[pg&nbsp;162]</span>
toward us or going away. But we could count
them, and, of course, that was great profit and
fun. So, while that battle raged, we fearlessly
strolled around the hill-side or sat in groups
and told stories, and one daredevil of a correspondent,
made reckless by the perils we had
passed, deliberately turned his back to the fight
and calmly read a newspaper.</p>

<p class="indent">The Three Guardsmen were justly pained by
such a neglect of such an opportunity to study
strategy and tactics in a great war, and they
did not look happy. Thus for two hours did
we not see the battle of Anshantien.</p>

<p class="indent">Toward noon the shell-smoke waned and we
moved on to another compound, where we were
to spend the night. At dusk a Guardsman
came in radiant and filled our hearts with
fatuous cheer. We were to see another fierce
engagement next morning. But we must rise
early and travel fast or we should be too late,
as the attack would be made before dawn. The
Three Guardsmen would come themselves to
awaken us at three o&#39;clock so that there could
be no mistake. He was so earnest and so sure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>[pg&nbsp;163]</span>
that we went to bed greatly excited, and nobody
slept except the Irishman, who lifted his
head from sound slumber, however, when one
vagrant beer-bottle was popped to decide a
wager, at midnight.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t you think I don&#39;t hear you,&quot; he
said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I win the bet,&quot; said Brill.</p>

<p class="indent">Three hours later, the Guardsmen found us
awake. We arose and stumbled in the mud
and darkness for a cup of coffee, and started
single file through raining blackness toward
that ever-vanishing front. Nobody said a
word, and the silence and mystery of the march
was oppressive as we waded streams and
ploughed through mud between walls of dripping
corn. Every now and then the Authority
on International Law, who led us, would
halt the column and get off his horse to look
for the trail that had been left for us the day
before. At least he did the looking, but it was
always Captain James, the Englishman, who
found the trail; a more stealing, mysterious,
conspirator-like expedition I have never known.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>[pg&nbsp;164]</span>
It was hard to believe that we were not
creeping up to make an attack on something
ourselves, or that the Russians might not
burst from the corn on either side at any
minute.</p>

<p class="indent">On we went until another hill loomed before
us, and at the foot of this hill we waited
for the dawn. By and by another cavalcade
approached, the military attachs, equally impressive,
equally mysterious, equally solemn
and expectant. And on that little hill we
waited, in the cold wind and drifting sleet and
rain, the correspondents huddled on top, the
cloaked attachs stalking along on a little terrace
some thirty feet below, everybody straining
his eyes through the darkness to see the first
flash of a gun. Morning came and we were
still straining&mdash;big Reggie nibbling a hard-boiled
egg on the very summit of the hill, a
Lieutenant-General of the English Army patrolling
the terrace like some &quot;knight-at-arms
alone and palely loitering,&quot; because no shells
sang, and the rest of us dotting the muddy
mound with miserable, shivering shapes, while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>[pg&nbsp;165]</span>
wind, rain, and cold made merry over the plight
of all. The Three Guardsmen moved restlessly
about, speaking words of good cheer; but
something was happening to that battle and we
got tired of straining and began to walk recklessly
around that hill and borrow chocolate
and tobacco and bread from one another for
breakfast. Even the Guardsmen got uneasy&mdash;hopeless&mdash;and
once I found myself on the
other side of the hill, where one of them lay
huddled in his army coat. For a little while
we talked inter-continental differences.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We do not understand, we Occidentals,
why the Japanese prefers to commit hara-kiri
rather than be captured, and we argue this way:
If I allow myself to be captured, I may be exchanged
or escape, and thus have a chance to
fight another day; if not, my enemy has to take
care of me and feed me, so that I reduce his
force and resources just that much. If I kill
myself I make a gap in my own ranks that I
can&#39;t fill again. If I accept capture, I am worrying
and exhausting you all the time. The
only good I can see in hara-kiri is the effect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>[pg&nbsp;166]</span>
that it might have on the fighting capacity of
the men who are left. Is there any economic
consideration of that sort under the Japanese
idea?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Guardsman shook his head. &quot;No,&quot; he
said, &quot;it is instinct with us; but,&quot; he added
presently, &quot;I think we are coming around to
your point of view, and I think we will come
around to it more and more. You see, we have
transferred the Buschido spirit of feudalism
into the army. The loyalty of Samurai to Daimio
has been transferred to soldier and officer,
and this instinct for hara-kiri is so great an
element in the Buschido spirit that I think our
officers are a little fearful about trying to
change it too rapidly.&quot; But a Japanese will
not talk long about such matters with a foreigner.</p>

<p class="indent">The Guardsman pulled a little brass check
covered with Chinese characters from his
pocket.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This is how we identify our dead,&quot; he said.
&quot;Every soldier carries one of these, and every
officer.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>[pg&nbsp;167]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s a good idea,&quot; I said, but I couldn&#39;t
help thinking how little use he could ever have
for that check as long as he was guarding us.
It is said that just about this time the wife of
a correspondent back in Tokio went trembling
to the War-Office. &quot;I have heard nothing
from my husband,&quot; she said. &quot;Tell me if he
has been killed.&quot; The official was startled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Impossible!&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">I climbed the hill again to see how that battle
was going on. The first line of &quot;The Burial
of Sir John Moore&quot; will do for that battle.
It wasn&#39;t going on, so one of the Guardsmen
galloped ahead to learn what the trouble was
with the Schedule, and for two long, chilly
hours we huddled on that windy mole-hill, with
no flash of gun in the distance, no puff of smoke
high in the air. The Guardsman came back
then. Kuropatkin had quietly sneaked away
while we were sneaking for that hill, and the
Japanese were after him. Thus passed the second
day of the battle of Anshantien.</p>

<p class="indent">At noon we were hitting the muddy trail
again for another Chinese compound. Evidently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>[pg&nbsp;168]</span>
we were getting nearer the front; the
flies and fleas were thicker here, a dead pig protruded
from a puddle of water in the centre
of the compound, and there were odors about
of man and horse, that suggested a recent occupation
by troops. We policed the filthy enclosure
that afternoon, and quite late the thunder
of big guns began far away, while a yellow
flame darted from the unseen sun, spread two
mighty saffron wings through the heavens,
fitted them together from earth and sky, and
left them poised motionless, while from them
stole slowly out the rich green-and-gold radiance
that comes only after rain&mdash;drenching wet
earth and still trees and quiet seas of corn. By
and by crickets chirped, quiet stars shone out
above the yellow, and the dusk came with a
great calm&mdash;but it was the calm that presaged
the storm of Liao-Yang.</p>

<p class="indent">We had a serious consultation that night.
The artists couldn&#39;t very well draw what they
couldn&#39;t see. Some of us, not being military
experts, and therefore dependent on mental pictures
and incident for material, were equally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>[pg&nbsp;169]</span>
helpless. Thus far the spoils of war had been
battle-fields, empty trenches, a few wounded
Japanese soldiers, and one Russian prisoner
in a red shirt. So, hearing that General Oku
feared for our safety, we sent him a round-robin
relieving him of any responsibility on
our account, and praying that we should be
allowed to go closer to the fighting, or our
occupation would be gone. Then we went to
sleep.</p>

<p class="indent">The straw that broke the camel&#39;s back was
added to the burden of the beast next morning.
The final word came from General Oku,
through a Guardsman, that the Russians were
in flight, that there would probably be no decisive
battle for some time and that if there
should be, we were to be allowed no closer
than four miles from the firing-line. Well,
you cannot see, that far away, how men
behave when they fight, are wounded, and
die&mdash;and as all battles look alike at a long
distance, there was nothing for some of us to
do but go home. So, on a bright sunny morning,
Richard Harding Davis, Melton Prior,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>[pg&nbsp;170]</span>
the wild Irishman, and I sat alone in the last
dirty compound, with the opening guns of Liao-Yang
booming in the distance. I had sold
Fuji to Guy Scull, and I wondered at the nerve
of the man, for the price, though small, was
big for Fuji. I pulled that vicious stallion&#39;s
wayward forelock with malicious affection several
times, and watched Scull curvet out on
him to a more dangerous fate than any danger
that war could hang over him. Away we went,
then, Davis, Prior, and the Irishman on horseback&mdash;what
became of his bicycle, I don&#39;t
know to this day&mdash;on the backward trail of the
war-dragon&mdash;for home. We went back
through Haicheng, and spent a few hours in
the same deserted compound that we had left
only a few days before. Its silence was eloquent
of the clash and clatter and storm of our
ten days&#39; imprisonment there. There we went
to see General Fukushima, who with great
alacrity gave us a pass back to Japan. He
could not understand why all of us would have
preferred to be at Port Arthur. It mystified
him a good deal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>[pg&nbsp;171]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;General,&quot; said Dean Prior, &quot;you promised
me that I should go to Port Arthur.&quot; The
General laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I tried to get you to stay for the third
column,&quot; he said, and Prior was silent, whether
from conviction or disgust, I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p class="indent">He wanted us to take a roundabout way to
Newchwang, so that we would be always under
Japanese protection. There were Chinese
bandits, he said, along the short cut that we
wanted to take, and there had been many murders
and robberies along that road. Just the
same, we took that road. So away we went,
with carts, coolies, interpreters, and servants&mdash;they
in the road and I stepping the ties of
the Siberian Railway. One hundred yards
ahead I saw two Japanese soldiers coming
toward me on the track. When they saw me&mdash;they
mistook me for a Russian, I suppose&mdash;they
jumped from the track and ran back along
the edge of a cornfield&mdash;disappearing every
now and then. I was a little nervous, for I
thought they might take a pot shot at me from
a covert somewhere, but they were only dashing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a>[pg&nbsp;172]</span>
back to announce my coming to a squad of soldiers,
and as I passed them on the track the
major in command grinned slightly when he
answered my salute.</p>

<p class="indent">We had a terrible pull that day through
the mud, and we reached a Chinese village at
dusk. The Irishman, with the subtle divination
that is his only, found by instinct the best
house in the town for us to stay. It had around
it a garden full of flowers, clean mats and antique
chairs within, and there was plenty of
good cold water and nice fresh eggs. My last
memory that night, as I lay on a cot under a
mosquito-net, was of the Irishman and our aged
host promenading up and down the garden-path.
The Chinaman had never heard a word
of English before in his life, but the Irishman
was talking to him with perfect gravity and
fluency about the war and about us, giving our
histories, what we had done and what we had
failed to do, and all the time the old Chinaman
was bowing with equal gravity, and smiling as
though not one word escaped his full comprehension.
How the Irishman kept it up for so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>[pg&nbsp;173]</span>
long, and why he kept it up for so long, I do
not know, but they were strolling up and down
when I went to sleep.</p>

<p class="indent">The next day we had another long pull
through deeper mud. For hours and hours we
went through solid walls of ten-foot corn;
sometimes we were in mud and water above
the knees. Once we got lost&mdash;anybody who
followed that Irishman always got lost&mdash;and
an old Chinaman led him and Davis and me
for miles through marshy cornfields. Sometimes
we would meet Chinamen bringing their
wives and children back home&mdash;now that both
armies had gone on ahead&mdash;the women in
carts, their faces always averted, and the children
dangling in baskets swung to either end
of a bamboo pole, and carried by father or
brother over one shoulder. By noon the kind
old Chinaman connected us with our caravansary
in another Chinese town. There the Irishman
got eggs by laying a pebble and cackling
like a hen, and the entire village gathered
around us to watch us eat our lunch. They
were all children from octogenarian down&mdash;simple,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>[pg&nbsp;174]</span>
kindly, humorous, and with a spirit
of accommodation and regard for the stranger
that I have never seen outside of our Southern
mountains. After lunch we took photographs
of them, and of ourselves in turn with them,
and the village policeman&mdash;he did not carry
even a stick&mdash;was a wag and actor, and made
beautiful poses while the village laughed <i>in
toto</i>. This would not have been possible in a
Japanese town. Nearly all of them followed
us out of the village, and they seemed sorry
to have us go.</p>

<p class="indent">Soon I tried a Chinese cart for a while, and
in spite of its jolting I almost went to sleep.
As I drowsed I heard a voice say:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;d better tell him to keep awake.&quot; Another
voice answered:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will take care of him,&quot; and I lifted my
hat, to see the ever-faithful Takeuchi stalking
along through the deep mud by me, with a big
stick in his hand. But we saw no bandits. It
was the middle of the afternoon now, and we
began to meet column after column of Japanese
troops moving toward the front from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>[pg&nbsp;175]</span>
new point of disembarkation&mdash;Newchwang.
Somehow, on the wind, a rumor was borne to
us that there was a foreign hotel in Newchwang
which had bath-tubs and beer and tansan; even
a wilder rumor came that the Russians had
left champagne there. We held a consultation.
If all those things were there, it were
just as well that some one of us should engage
them for the four as quickly as possible. The
happy lot fell to me, and I mounted Dean
Prior&#39;s great white horse and went ahead at
a gallop. That horse was all right loping in
a straight line, but if there was a curve to be
turned or a slippery bank to descend, his weak
back drew mortality for the rider very near.
Then he had an ungovernable passion for lying
down in mud-holes and streams, which held
distinct possibilities for discomfort. Twice he
went down with me on the road, though he
walked over a stream on a stone arch that was
not two feet wide in perfect safety. In one
river, too, he went down, and we rolled together
for a little while in the yellow mud and
water; but I ploughed a way through columns
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>[pg&nbsp;176]</span>
of troops, and, led by a Chinese guide, reached
Newchwang at sunset. I went to the Japanese
headquarters, but could learn nothing about
that hotel. I asked directions of everybody,
and when, going down the street, I saw coming
toward me through the dust a boy with a tennis-racquet
over his shoulder and a real white girl
in a white dress, with black hair hanging down
her back, I asked directions again, merely that
I might look a little longer upon that girl&#39;s
face. It seemed a thousand years since I had
seen a woman who looked like her. I found
the hotel, and I got rooms for ourselves and
quarters for our servants and horses. Looking
for a stable in the dark, I turned a corner, to
see a Japanese naked bayonet thrust within
a foot of my breast. Naturally, I stopped, but
as it came no nearer, I went on, and not a word
was said by the sentinel nor by me. None of
my companions came in, and I ate dinner in
lonely magnificence, put beer, champagne, and
tansan on ice, gave orders that the servants
should wait until midnight, and sent guides
out to wait for Davis and Prior and the Irishman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>[pg&nbsp;177]</span>
at the city gates. Then I went to bed.
About two o&#39;clock there was a pounding on my
door, and a little Japanese officer with a two-handed
sword some five feet long came in and
arrested me as a Russian spy. He said I would
have to leave Newchwang by the earliest train
the next morning. Now, if I had had wings
I should have been cleaving the Manchurian
darkness at that very minute for home, and
with a little more self-control I should have
hung out the window and laughed when he
made that direful threat. But I had ridden
into that town on the biggest white horse I
ever saw, and I looked like an English field-marshal
without his blouse. I had gone to the
Japanese headquarters. I had registered my
name and the names of my three friends on the
hotel-book. I had filled out the blank that is
usual for the passing stranger in time of war.
I had added information that was not asked
for on that blank. I had engaged four rooms,
had ordered dinner for four people, and had
things to eat and things to drink awaiting for
the other three whenever they should come. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>[pg&nbsp;178]</span>
had my war-pass in my pocket, which I displayed,
and yet this Japanese officer, the second
in command at Newchwang and a graduate of
Yale, as I learned afterward, woke me up at
two o&#39;clock in the morning, and in excellent
English put me under arrest as a Russian spy.
I was robed only in a blue flannel shirt and a
pair of &quot;Bonnie Maginns,&quot; but I sprang shamelessly
from out that mosquito-netting, and I
said things that I am not yet sorry for. Over
that scene I will draw the curtain quickly&mdash;but
just the same, a Japanese soldier sat at my door
all through the night. The next morning I
heard a great noise, and I saw our entire train
in the street below. I called my sentinel to
the window and pointed out to him four carts,
twelve horses and mules, eight coolies, and
eight interpreters and servants, and I asked
him if Russian spies were accustomed to travel
that way&mdash;if they did business with a circus
procession and a brass band? He grinned
slightly.</p>

<p class="indent">Half an hour later Davis and I went down
to see the Yale graduate, and he apologized.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>[pg&nbsp;179]</span>
He said graciously that he would remove the
guard from my door, and I did not tell him
that that intelligent soldier had voluntarily removed
himself an hour before. We told him
we were very anxious to get back to Yokohama
to catch a steamer for home. He said
that we probably would not be allowed to go
home on a transport, and that even if we had
permission we could not, for the reason that
no transports were going.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is none going to-day?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nor to-morrow?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nor the day after?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">We said good-by. Just outside the door we
met another Japanese officer who had been sent
into Manchuria with a special message from
the Emperor, and had been told incidentally
to look in on the correspondents. He had
looked in on us above Haicheng, and he was
apparently trying to do all he could for us.
He was quite sure if we saw the Major in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>[pg&nbsp;180]</span>
Command there, that we should be allowed to
go. &quot;Is there a transport going to-day?&quot; I
asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; he said, &quot;I am taking it myself.&quot;
I kept my face grave.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And to-morrow?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And the next day?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Three of them&mdash;all useless&mdash;nailed within
five minutes from the lips of a brother-officer
and within ten steps of the Yale graduate&#39;s
door! It was to laugh.</p>

<p class="indent">I took a Chinese sampan, and with sail and
oar beat up that yellow river for an hour to
find the Major in Command. When I got to
his office, he had gone to tiffin. Where did
he tiffin? The answer was a shake of the head.
Nobody could disturb the gallant major while
he was tiffining, no matter how urgent the caller&#39;s
business was. When would he return?
Within one hour and a half. Well, we would
have just a little more than another hour in
which to catch that transport, even if we got
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>[pg&nbsp;181]</span>
permission to take it. And somehow cooling
heels in the ante-chamber of the Major while
he tiffined had no particular charm for me just
then, so I decided very quickly to start back
by Chefoo and Shanghai, even if it did take
five extra days and perhaps cause us to lose
the steamer for home.</p>

<p class="indent">So we gathered our things together and took
passage on a British steamer for China. A Chinese
sampan took the ever-faithful Takeuchi
and me with our luggage to the ship. I handed
Takeuchi two purple fifty-sen bills that the
army issues in Manchuria as scrip&mdash;to give to
the Chinaman&mdash;and started up the gangway
toward the Captain&#39;s cabin. Takeuchi thought
I had gone, but I looked around just in time
to see him thrust one of the bills in his own
pocket, give the Chinaman the other, put his
right foot against the Chinaman&#39;s breast, and
joyously kick him down the gangway into the
sampan. Selah!</p>

<p class="indent">The joy of being on a British ship with the
Union Jack over you and no Japanese to say
you nay! Never shall I forget that England
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>[pg&nbsp;182]</span>
liberated the slave. She freed some of the
White Slaves of Haicheng.</p>

<p class="indent">To avoid floating mines we anchored that
night outside the bar, but next morning we
struck the wide, free, blue seas, with an English
captain, whose tales made Gulliver&#39;s Travels
sound like the story of a Summer in a Garden.
Without flies, fleas, mosquitoes, or scorpions,
we slept when and where we pleased and
as long as we pleased. Once more we wore the
white man&#39;s clothes and ate his food and drank
his drink, and were happy. In the afternoon
we passed for miles through the scattered cargoes
of Chinese junks that had been destroyed
by the Japanese while on their way to supply
the Russians at Port Arthur, and that night
we saw the flash of big guns as once more we
swept near the fortress we had hoped to see.
A sunny, still day once again and we were at
Chefoo, where in the harbor we saw&mdash;glory of
glories!&mdash;an American Man-of-War. Ashore
Chefoo was distinctly shorn of the activities
that lately had made the town hum. There
were only a Russian or two there from a destroyed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>[pg&nbsp;183]</span>
torpedo-boat, a few missionaries in rickshaws
and dressed like Chinese, a few queer-looking
foreign women in the streets, and a
lonely, smooth-shaven young man from Chicago,
who ran a roulette-wheel and took in
more kinds of Oriental currency than I knew
to exist.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am sorry the Russians have gone,&quot; he
said; &quot;they were great gamblers.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There we learned that fighting was going on
at Liao-Yang&mdash;real, continuous fighting; and
a melancholy of which no man spoke set in
strong with all of us. But there was that
American Man-of-War out in the harbor, and
Davis and I went out to her and climbed
aboard. We saw nice, clean American boys
again, and pictures of their sisters and sweethearts,
and we had dinner and wine, and we
made that good ship shake from stem to stern
with song.</p>

<p class="indent">Two days later we were threading a way
through a wilderness of ships of all the nations
of the earth into Shanghai. Shanghai&mdash;that
&quot;Paris of the East&quot;&mdash;with its stone buildings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>[pg&nbsp;184]</span>
and hotels and floating flags; its beautiful
Bund bordered with trees and parks and paths,
its streets thronged with a medley of races and
full of modern equipages, rattling cabs, rattling
rickshaws, and ancient Chinese wheelbarrows
each with one big wooden wheel, pushed by a
single Chinaman with a strap over his shoulder,
and weighted, sometimes, with six Chinese factory-girls,
their tiny feet dangling down&mdash;and
all this confusion handled and guarded by
giant, red-turbaned Sikh policemen&mdash;each bearing
himself with the dignity of a god. There
was gay life in Shanghai&mdash;good and bad; town
clubs and country clubs, with tennis, cricket,
and golf. There were beautiful roads, filled
with handsome carriages and smart men and
women on smart horses, and there were road-houses
with men and women who were not so
smart seated around little tables all over the
verandas, with much music coming from within.
Along that Bund at night were house-boats
anchored, on the decks of which people dined
among red candles to the music of a brass band
in a park near by&mdash;brilliantly lit. And there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>[pg&nbsp;185]</span>
was a Chinese quarter not far away, thronged
with strange faces, with narrow, twisting
streets, some murky and some gay with lanterns
that hung from restaurants, theatres, opium
dens, singing and gambling halls, while
through those streets coolies bore high on their
shoulders gayly dressed Chinese singing-girls
from one hall to another.</p>

<p class="indent">On the ship for Nagasaki were many young
Chinese boys and girls going to other lands to
be educated, and I was given two significant
bits of information: &quot;Ten years ago,&quot; said a
man, &quot;a foreign education was a complete bar
to political preferment over here. Things have
so changed and a foreign education is now such
an advantage that rich Chinamen who have
political aspirations for their sons purposely
send them abroad to be educated.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;On this ship,&quot; said another, &quot;and the two
ships that follow her, many hundred young
Chinamen are going over to Japan to get a
military training. And yet, according to some
observers, there is nothing doing in China&mdash;even
on the part of Japan.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>[pg&nbsp;186]</span>
We landed at Nagasaki and had a three
nights&#39; ride to Yokohama in a crowded car in
which it was possible to sleep only when sitting
upright. On the third day the long train came
to a stop at daybreak and every Japanese soul
in it&mdash;man, woman, and child&mdash;poured out,
each with a towel, scrubbed vigorously at a
water-trough and came back, each sawing on
his teeth with a wooden tooth-brush. Such a
scene could be paralleled nowhere else. I suppose
the Japanese are the cleanliest people in
the world.</p>

<p class="indent">Tokio at last&mdash;and a request from the Japanese:
Would we consider going back to Port
Arthur? We would not.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Please consider the question.&quot; We considered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; we said, &quot;we will go.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You can&#39;t,&quot; said the Japanese.</p>

<p class="indent">Right gladly then we struck the backward
trail of the Saxon. The Happy Exile went
aboard with me, and so did Takeuchi, who
brought his pretty young wife along to say,
&quot;How d&#39;ye do?&quot; and &quot;Good-by.&quot; Takeuchi
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>[pg&nbsp;187]</span>
brought a present, too&mdash;a little gold mask of
a fox, which he thought most humorously fitting&mdash;a
scarf-pin for Inari-sama, which is the
honorific deistical form of my honorable name
in Japanese. Later, in this country, I got Takeuchi&#39;s
photograph and this card: &quot;I wish you
please send me your recommondation which is
necessary to have in my business.&quot; He shall
have it.</p>

<p class="indent">All my life Japan had been one of the two
countries on earth I most wanted to see. No
more enthusiastic pro-Japanese ever put foot
on the shore of that little island than I was
when I swung into Yokohama Harbor nearly
seven months before. I had lost much&mdash;but I
was carrying away in heart and mind the nameless
charm of the land and of the people&mdash;for
the charm of neither has much succumbed to the
horrors imported from us; Fujiyama, whose
gray head lies close under the Hand of Benediction;
among the foot-hills below the Maid of
Miyanoshita&mdash;may Fuji keep her ever safe from
harm; O-kin-san the kind, who helps the poor
and welcomes the stranger&mdash;her little home at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>[pg&nbsp;188]</span>
the head of the House of the Hundred Steps
I could see from the deck of the ship; the great
Daibutsu at Kamakura, whose majestic calm
stills all the world while you look upon his face
and&mdash;the babies, in streets and doorways&mdash;the
babies that rule the land as kings. I did have,
too, for a memory, Shin&mdash;my rickshaw man&mdash;but
Shin failed me at the last minute on the
dock. Yes, even at that last minute on the
dock, Shin tried to fool me. But I forgive him.</p>

<p class="indent">Of this war in detail I knew no more than
I should have known had I stayed at home&mdash;and
it had taken me seven months to learn that
it was meant that I should not know more.
There can be no quarrel with what was done&mdash;only
with the way it was done&mdash;which was not
pretty. Somehow, as Japan sank closer to the
horizon, I found myself wondering whether the
Goddess of Truth couldn&#39;t travel the breadth
of that land incog.&mdash;even if she played the
leading part in a melodrama with a star in her
forehead and her own name emblazoned in
Japanese ideographs around her breast. I
think so. I wondered, too, if in shedding the

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
